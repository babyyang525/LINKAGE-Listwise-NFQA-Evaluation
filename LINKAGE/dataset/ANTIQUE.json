Antibodies themself are not able to attack molecules, but essentially act as a signal to cells within the immune system that something is foreign.... Hope this helps!!!. Katie",

Success in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.. . I am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don\u2019t want you to know about.. . Before I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. . . So how does your body burn fat?. . It is a 2 steps process and in order you need to:. 1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then. 2.You can burn the fat. . . That process is the same for every human being. I will outline the steps and then show you how you can easily apply some fundamental rules to allow your body to burn the maximum amount of fat with less effort and minimum time. Once you understand that simple process, you can easily see why you are not getting the results that you want. Even bigger, you will finally see that getting that dream body is getting so much closer to reality that you will be extremely motivated to get started as soon as you can.. . How does your body release the fat from the cells?. . Before you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Include small amounts of good fats.. 3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. . The most misunderstood weight loss strategy. How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . Releasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, don\u2019t go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.. . The reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just don\u2019t cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you don\u2019t. But wait there is a solution to that\u2026. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . The world most efficient \u201cfat burner\u201d is FREE and You already have it.. . Before I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. . Weight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic \u201cfat burner\u201d that will melt your fat away. The problem is that they have a new one coming out every year, so I wonder if the one from last year was so effective, why we need a new one. Ther",

This kind of claims are planned just to cause clients to make impulsive decisions. When you gain weight, did you gained around 50 minds in two months? Certainly not. We gain weight in weight in small parts, which add up to our weight. This keeps on increasing with time.. . I think you get what I mean to say. We normally gain weight in grams like 65 gram per week. With this stat you are going to gain around 7 pounds at the end of year.. . This weight is so slow that you cannot measure it weekly. But in fur years you are going to gain around 28 pounds.. . So how can you expect this weight to go in few days? You are going to lose the way you have gained it. So it will take time to lose weight. So you have to start losing weight systematically. You can lose weight by developing the good eating habits in you and nutritious foods.",

Hundreds of instantly cured hiccuper's have sent in their testimony's of deliverance! Files are available for researchers! Carefully understand both the HOW and the WHY of this method. If you don't get the WHY you might not get the HOW. Here's how to cure the hiccups:. . \"Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure\"\u00a9 1997. . (1) Pour a TALL glass of water.. . (2) Hold your breath... ***. . (3) IMPORTANT...PINCH YOUR NOSE CLOSED.. . (4) Slowly, take 10 - 20 swallows of the water...while holding your breath with your nose pinched closed.. . (5) When you can't stand it any more....you'll know by that overwhelming drowning sensation -- after a gasp, take a deep breath and relax.. . This cures the hiccups 99 percent of the time - guaranteed! It's a proven medical remedy! (A second treatment could be necessary for stubborn cases.). . *** For stubborn cases, try EXHALING COMPLETELY and then taking 10 - 20 swallows.. . NOW: HERE'S WHY IT WORKS: Hiccups are caused by an uncontrollable spasm in the diaphragm, (the \"breathing\" muscle). Often, this spasm is triggered by irritable conditions in the smooth muscles of the stomach or the esophagus. The \"Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure\" forces an increase in the carbon dioxide levels in the diaphragm itself, as well as in the stomach and esophagus. By swallowing, you are making the muscles work -- so they use up their available oxygen and replace it with carbon dioxide. By temporarily discontinuing to breath, you prohibit new oxygen from entering your body and thus create an anaerobic condition in the spasming diaphragm muscle. When the spasming diaphragm and stomach are deprived temporarily of oxygen and encounter the higher levels of carbon dioxide ... you feel that scary drowning sensation! BUT this causes the spasming muscles to relax! The hiccups go away! Essentially, you are \"tricking\" your body into thinking that it's drowning ... and it decides to use it's resources for something other than hiccuping. The rather \"scary\" drowning sensation caused by this method is NECESSARY for the method to work. If it's not just a little bit difficult ... it doesn't work.",

But another overlooked function of either of the glycols is to help raise the boiling point of the water.  Remember in science class...anything added to water like that will lower freezing point and also raise boiling point as well.  The pressure cap on the radiator keeps the pressure at from 7 to 15 p. s. i. which increases the boiling point as well.  That way all your water will not boil away quickly.",

If the coolant level is not the trouble, have the pressure cap tested and if faulty replace. Be sure to use the recommended pressure rated cap. Water boils at 215 degrees F, but with a 50/50 mix anti-freeze and water and a 15 lbs pressure cap the coolant boil point raises to 230 degrees F.

A yawn (synonyms chasma, oscitation from the Latin verb oscitare, to open the mouth wide[1]) is a reflex of deep inhalation and exhalation associated with being tired, with a need to sleep, or from lack of stimulation. Pandiculation is the term for the act of stretching and yawning. Yawning is a powerful non-verbal message with several possible meanings, depending on the circumstances. It is also claimed to help increase the state of alertness of a person. The exact causes of yawning are still unknown.. . Contents.  [hide]. 1 Origin of the word. 2 Causes of yawning. 3 Contagiousness. 4 Trivia. 5 Superstitions. 6 Notes. 7 External links. [edit]Origin of the word. . The word \"yawn\" has evolved from the Middle English word yanen, an alteration of yonen, or yenen, which in turn comes from the Old English geonian.. [edit]Causes of yawning. . An indication of tiredness, stress, over-work, or boredom.. An action indicating psychological decompression after a state of high alert.. A means of expressing powerful emotions like anger, rejection, apathy or tedium.. Caused by low oxygen in the brain. A yawn can express strong anti-social messages, and so in some cultures people try to mute or mask them by placing a concealing hand over the yawning mouth.. . . A cat yawning. A previous long-standing hypothesis is that yawning is caused by an excess of carbon dioxide and lack of oxygen in the blood. The brain stem detects this and triggers the yawn reflex. The mouth stretches wide and the lungs inhale deeply, bringing oxygen into the lungs and hence to the bloodstream. It is almost certain, however, that this hypothesis is not correct. One study has documented that this effect does not exist.[2]. A more recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature. Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain that affect emotions, mood, appetite and other phenomena. These chemicals include serotonin, dopamine, glutamic acid and nitric oxide. As more of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of opiate neurotransmitters such as endorphins, reduces the frequency of yawning. Patients taking the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil (Paroxetine HCl) have been observed yawning abnormally often. Another theory is that yawning is similar to stretching. Yawning, like stretching, increases blood pressure and heart rate while also flexing many muscles and joints. It is also theorized that yawning helps redistribute an oil-like substance which coats the lungs and aids breathing. Some have observed that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is unsatisfying. As such, the stretching of jaw and face muscles seems to be necessary for a good yawn.. Some movements in psychotherapy such as Re-evaluation Counseling or co-counselling believe that yawning, along with laughter and crying are means of \"discharging\" painful emotion, and therefore can be encouraged in order to promote physical and emotional healing.. [edit]Contagiousness. . The yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to \"sympathetically\" yawn.[3] The proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons, i.e. neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific (same species) and occasionally interspecific organisms, activates the same regions in the brain[4]. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for Imitation which lies at the root of much human learning, e.g. language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse. At a distal level (in terms of evolutionary advantage), yawning might be a herd instinct.[5] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synch",

In an effort to find the answer, the Finnish government recently funded a brain scanning study. The results turned up some hard-to-interpret, possible clues.

Cows need to be born and raised, given shots and medical care, fed and housed. They produce a limited amount of milk each day. Then the milk gets pasteurized and packaged in individual containers, and has to be transported in a way that keeps it cold the whole time. If it is on the shelf or in transit too long, you won't be able to drink it. Oil on the other hand is already in the ground and is pipelined to a place where it can be pumped into ships, trucks, or barrels. It doesn't need to stay cold and lasts forever. It can be transported without the expense of individual packages. Contrary to what many think today, there are still abundant supplies of it. As the supply decreases, the price will go up to above that of milk. In countries closer to the source, such as Kuwait, gas only costs about 82 cents per gallon, which is less than the cost of water there!",

Plus most people don't say anything about it, so the rude ones get so used to this behavior they don't realize how big of jerks they are being.Try pointing out their rudeness to them sometimes. I was shopping a few weeks ago and a woman asked me if I knew where a certain section was. I told her then she just walked off! I hollered after her that she was welcome. She hesitated and kind of ducked her head, which I think was caused by her realizing how rude her actions were. It may be wishful thinking, but I don't think so. I have no problem pointing out the rudeness of others to them and most become embarassed because they realize exactly how rude they are being. If more people would be nicer, we could bring back politeness. Kill 'em with kindness!!",

It is very difficult to identify especially in the young age. One striking difference is almost all gold fish scales are very shiny and koi may be colourful but not so shiny. The second important feature is Koi will grow very fast but gold fish comparatively low. The caudal fin of Koi always will be simple but gold fish mostly it is fan like. When you are selecting very small fishes, this can be easily noticed.If you need only gold fish select those have fan type caudal fin. Koi colour patches are not soo unique and attractive like gold fish but except the variety calico most of the gold fishes have definite and attractive patterns.Koi is ideal only for garden pools but gold fish can be from small indoor tanks to garden pools. Koi's basic stucture is very similar to Common carp and doenot have a pot belly similar to gold fish, Koi is more or less spindle shape with longer body than caudal fin but gold fish especially if they are young, caudal fin length is equal to the body length except in one or two cases. Gold fish body width wlll come down immediately after the stomach and form tail. But koi posterior part slowly narrow down to have a caudal peduncle to form a simple tail.

I don't think you aquire these tastes until you are older- so I think younger kids drink to be cool.. . Some people like the taste in moderation and have a glass or two.  Some people drink it more often as the beverage of choice.  Some people will drink a lot when they are going out to have fun with friends - just to let loose.  . . Hope that helps- take care!",

While alcohol is a depressant, what it first affects is their inhibitions; people are more likely to perform acts that they may not usually do - like many people have mentioned, attempt a sexual encounter, or perform daredevil-type stunts.. . It taste bitter, why do people like to drink?.     Not all alcohols taste bitter - ice wine, for example, tastes almost syropy, and the alcohol taste is non-existant.  Beers are bitter because of the hops, a bitter vegetable part (I forget if it's a flower or some other part).  Alcohol is very disagreeable (to me), but it's usually the other flavours that make it worthwhile.. . Are they just showing off?.      Not at first.... see answer one for details.. . Or do they truely enjoy it?.      I like the taste of the alcoholic beverages, like beers, scotches, and whiskeys.  Some people will put up with the taste just to get to the 'drunken' state.  I have never understood why blacking out is so much fun, especially if you cannot remember it, but there are people like that, and in North America, that is their right.",

Therefore they developed a system of people voting in order say who they wanted to represent their best intrests. The founding fathers, though, where white protestant males of upper and middle class status, and thus feared the what they considered to be the uneducated and uninformed masses. That is why they developed the electoral college, so that even if a candiate won the popular vote, they would not necessarily become president.

That one of George Bush's first acts as President, in January 2001, was to end the two-year deployment of attack submarines which were positioned within striking distance of al Qaeda's Afghanistan camps, even as the group's guilt for the Cole bombing was established, proves that a transition from one administration to the next is never an easy task.. . That so many influential figures in and close to the Bush White House had expressed, just a year before the attacks, the need for a \"new Pearl Harbor\" before their militarist ambitions could be fulfilled, demonstrates nothing more than the accidental virtue of being in the right place at the right time.. .

Bush made the mistake of thinking this would be a quick and painless war, one that would look good on the evening news, and increase his popularity rating. I personally believe Bush should be impeached for starting this war. He lied to Congress, and he lied to us.

If you are getting a loan/mortgage, some mortgage companies require that you insure against loss/damage etc. therefore you have to have insurance.  If you don't have insurance then there is absolutely no way to possibly protect yourself.. . Also, in the UK you have to have insurance for cars so there is no choice in the matter.",

A few examples are your auto, life, home, and/or business.  . A liability is an expense you owe someone/something or may owe someone/something else in the future.. When you purchase this very important coverage on any insurance policy you are protecting yourself against a future expense that may occur.. Each asset mentioned above has different types of liability coverages, that protect you from having to pay large or small amounts out of your pocket.. Your insurance agent should be knowledgeable and a person you trust, someone you see as a financial counselor.  The next time your policy renews or if you are purchasing a policy for the first time make sure to discuss if the coverages are ADEQUETE for you and your family.",

Mind you, that you are using a transflash or a Micro SD card, you can put whatever you want on the card, it might not (or in most cases, will not) show up on the phone.... . Your phone comes with a USB cable that hooks to your phone. while it's hooked up, your phone is off and in file transfer mode. Most likely, you need to be running Windows XP on your comp to use it, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to do cool things with it. (I think you can send people songs from your phone, but read the manual to be sure!). . By the way, be careful with your card, and try not to remove it from the phone too much if you don't need to. If you have to transfer it to a card reader, be careful, because Micro SD cards are VERY sensitive.. . Enjoy, and I hope this helps alittle.",

In America, when the country was founded, it was just a handful of colonies who were essentially from the same countries, same race, same religion. They were fleeing religious persecution from their own religions. Now, over two hundred years later, America's much bigger with a lot more people coming here for those same freedoms.. . The right to religious freedom isn't restricted to the Christian religions of our founding fathers. They guaranteed that freedom for everyone, even if they couldn't possibly foresee how far that freedom would reach. There are more people, more nationalities and religions here than ever before, so it's even more important now to safeguard that right.. . If we don't, and we become a theocracy, all but 1% of the nation is going to have to either convert, leave, or risk being arrested or worse. I don't know about you, but I'd rather take an imperfect system and be able to improve upon it than fear for my life because I didn't convert to the religion my government told me to.",

I think it is important that this does not happen in the US anymore and would like to think that it is because we have matured as a society. You'd think we have grown, but I am skeptical as the same thing happens behind closed doors so that instead of physical harm (most of time because there are always extremists who think they are above the law), mental harm is inflicted. So have we grown, or have we digressed...that is true question behind the supposed freedom of religion declaration.",

Thrust is an aerodynamic force that must be created by an airplane in order to overcome the drag (notice that thrust and drag act in opposite directions in the figure above).

Also, put some of her poop in the box the first time to help her. Always leave a little of the previous waste in the box when you empty it to help her remember where to go.  We kept ours in the bathroom so we had one litter box.  If you are going to let her hop around the whole house you will need a litter box in almost every room to begin with so that she can become trained.  Also, you want to be careful that cords are tied up out of her way so that she won't chew on them.  Our bunny chewed the baseboard around our bathroom.  You might want to spray it with bitter apple to keep the bunny from chewing on it or other things that are low.  Good luck and have fun.

            "passage": "Actually, there are a lot of considerations to think about when bringing a bunny indoors.  Personally, I think it is a much better environment for them, but you need to understand that they may not immediately take to your surroundings the way you would like.  Firstly, there is the cage training/litter training thing.  Rabbits are naturally neat creatures and therefore are fairly easy to train.  The key is patience.  Also, if your rabbit has not been spayed, you might want to have this done as it will make potty training easier.  My suggestion is to line a cat litter pan with newspaper, then cover that in hay.  This will give the bunny a reason to go into the pan in the first place, as well as something to dig around in to cover up their \"business\" when they are done.  . . Another important thing to consider is chewing.  Because a rabbit's teeth are constantly growing, they chew to keep them ground down.  Make sure your bun has plenty of safe chew toys to play with.  Mine  love cardboard boxes, telephone books, wooden bird toys, and baby teething keys.  One thing to remember is that wires and the like are often found at floor level, making them a convenient place for a bun to chew.  Not only is this bad for your home electronics, it can give your rabbit a nasty shock too!  Your local electronics store should have some good, sturdy cable wraps to tuck away such temptations.  . . You should also think about restricting your rabbit's access to carpeted areas of the house.  Often rabbits will attempt to graze on carpet, which of course, destroys the rug in question, and can also make the rabbit sick.  Some rabbits never have this problem, and others are seemingly impossible to break from it, so it's all about trying things out with your bun, and seeing what works for you both.  . . If you have any specific questions about bunny training, or keeping house rabbits, feel free to e-mail me (hmelton@sbcglobal.net) anytime.  I currently have 3 sweet little buns living in my house, and have kept indoor rabbits for years.  . . Hope this helps -- and check out the site listed below for some good reading on the subject!",

The illness often starts in childhood but can develop at any age.. . At leas t 1 child in 7 [in the UK] suffers from asthma, and the number affected has increased dramatically in recent years. Childhood asthma can be outgrown in about half of all cases.. . DURING AN ASTHMA ATTACK, the muscle in the walls of the airways contracts, causing narrowing. The linings of the airways also become swollen and inflamed, producing excess mucus which can block the smaller airways.. . In some people, an allergic reaction triggers the asthma attack.. . This allergic type of asthma tends to occur in childhood and may develop in association with eczema or certain other allergic condition such as hay fever or rhinitis.. Susceptibility to these conditions frequently runs in families and may be inherited.. . Some substances, called allergens, are known to trigger attacks of allergic asthma. These  include pollen, house-dust mites, mould, and dander and saliva from furry animals such as cats and dogs.. . In very rare cases, some fods, such as milk, eggs, nuts and wheat, provoke an allergic asthmatic reaction.. . Some people with asthma are sensitive to aspirin, and taking it may trigger an attack.. . When asthmas starts in adulthood, there are usually no identifiable allergic trigers. The 1st attack is sometimes brought on by a respiratory infection.",

Girls want a manly man and a guy that is dangerous.  It all goes back to the excitment theory.  Also, girls want a man that is strong and full of confidence.  Some \"sweet\" guys are often shy and are willing to allow a woman to run all over them.  Even though some women might like that power, but overall, most women want a man that can be a leader and not a follower.  It is a double edged sword.  We want a powerful sweatheart.

The decoration of Easter eggs to further enhance their value became an art form centuries ago and continues today. Dyes made from vegetables, edible flowers, fruits, coffee, tea, leaves, bark, and roots were used to tint the eggs. Lovely designs were created by wrapping the eggs in ferns before tinting. The art progressed, with western Europeans becoming expert at creating intricate patterns in vibrant colors on the small eggs. . . Here are explanations of some of the many types of decorated eggs: . . \u2022 Etched: Traced back to Macedonia, this process involves dying the egg, applying a layer of wax in a design, then bleaching off the color leaving only the wax-covered areas with color.. . \u2022 Krashanky: The Ukrainian word means color, and these eggs are dyed a solid, brilliant color, often red to symbolize the blood shed by Christ on the cross.. . \u2022 Faberg\u00e9: Probably some of the most famous and most expensive Easter eggs known are those created by Russian jeweler Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 in the 1800's. The eggs were made of gold, silver and jewels and most opened up to reveal exquisite tiny figures of people, animals, plants or buildings. A total of 57 eggs were made. These are obviously museum artifacts of high value.. . \u2022 Jeweled: Designs are created by gluing any manner of sequins, beads, flowers, etc., onto blown eggs.. . \u2022 Cut-Out or Carved: Blown eggs are used also for these creations where a portion of the shell is cut away. The exterior is decorated, and the inside filled with a little scene to be viewed through the cut-out section. These can be exquisitely elaborate.",

A drug recommended by many dermatologists for the worst cases of acne scars is Accutane. It is the wonder drug of the 21st century to prevent acne scarring in acne sufferers.. . Accutane is a very controversial drug to use as it can cause birth defects. Doctors caution that you should always check whether you're pregnant or liable to be pregnant before commencing a course.",

While legislation for public highways first appeared in 1916, with revisions in 1921, it was not until Congress enacted an even more comprehensive version of the act in 1925 that the government executed its plan for national highway construction.. . Officially, the numerical designation 66 was assigned to the Chicago-to-Los Angeles route in the summer of 1926. With that designation came its acknowledgment as one of the nation's principal east-west arteries.. . From the outset, public road planners intended U.S. 66 to connect the main streets of rural and urban communities along its course for the most practical of reasons: most small towns had no prior access to a major national thoroughfare.. . http://www.national66.com/66hstry.html",

When the brain receives an impulse of something that is reoccuring over and over again, it will store it as a memory so it will be remembered.

What's the difference here?  Hard drives have moving parts and don't deal well with lots of sudden physical movements.  Flash memory is in the form of chips with no moving parts.  So, if you want a mp3 player for the gym or jogging use a flash based one; hard drive mp3 players are not advised.  It is a trade-off between resilience (flash memory) and capacity (hard drives).",

Almost always obedient, it is always eager to please its master. It is an extremely courageous and intelligent guard dog that is very full of vitality. Highly protective of his owners and the owner's property, it will fight an enemy to the death. It is usually very friendly, but has an uncanny ability to know when it needs to protect and when everything is okay. The American Pit Bull Terrier can be willful and needs a firm hand. They are generally okay with other pets if they are raised with them from puppy hood.  For the most part they are very friendly, but not recommended for most people. Excellent with children in the family, they have a high pain tolerance and will happily put up with rough child play.\" http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/americanpitbull.htm",

They believe that they are qualified in making the decision on what breed is worthy to live or not.  They believe that owners of said dogs have no responsibility towards the dog that cause the accident and should be allowed to carry on with life as it was before.  Meanwhile the dog gets destroyed.  The media then plays into those beliefs to get more support to push the issue.. . To my knowledge there are several Canadian cities that have muzzle laws or ban the breed specifically, as well as many American states, counties, and cities that ban these breeds.

However, when a pit bull bites, it is more likely to be fatal. . A lot of this legislation has been based on statistical data from the CDC that breaks down dog bite related fatalities according to the breed of dog. Right now rottweilers and pit bulls are at the top of the list. Statisitics that break up dog bite related fatalities are inaccurate in a lot of ways. They do no account for the percentage of the dog population - popular breeds will obviously show up more than rare ones. Also, they do not take into account the role the owner plays. Because of their reputations, pit bulls are often selected by people who want a mean dog. You can make a golden retriever mean if you want to, but you wouldn't get one if you wanted to. So pit bulls end up being more likely to be mean b/c they are more likely to be purchased by idiots. I posted a list of resources over in the page about rottie v. pit bull, if you would like to look at that.",

Also I heard an invitation to accept Jesus.Until then I didn't realize  my need for salvation.. . And the \"clincher\" was going to a bible study. My first one was called \"Examine the Evidence\". I learned how the bible was written by many different people, divinely inspired by God, from many different back grounds and locations and time periods. And that the bible was written over a long period of time. And despite all of  that, it is in perfect harmony from Genesis to Revelation.. . And I'm sure that having my saved sisters pray for me for many years had a lot to do with it too!!!. . Thank you for an opportunity to share. It is so cool that you came to know Yeshua the Messiah! Keep telling people about Him!. . And David - with no disrespect to \"Names are much too...\" You made the right decision and Jesus is the Messiah that the Jews have been waiting for. . here is link that may be helpful-. http://jewsforjesus.org/",

There is a reason to live a true, Holy repentant life as He is alive and He will come back for His people. Those that do not choose to believe this way will be punished the Bible says by living in eternal damnation, Hell. Those that choose life and believe will be saved. How to be saved? Acts 2:38 clearly gives a path:. 1. Repent- tell God you are sorry for your sins. 2. Be baptized in JESUS name- not the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost it must be in HIS name. 3. Receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  This is evidence that you have received Jesus Christ into your heart as you will speak with other tongues as the spirit gives utterance. .

When one is baptized, one is baptized into Christ's death, simulating his death and burial, and then raised up to walk in newness of life, simulating his resurrection (ROMANS 6:3,4; COLOSSIANS 2:12). The Bible tells us that we put on Christ in baptism (GALATIANS 3:27), while ACTS 2:38 tells to be baptized for the remission (forgiveness) of our sins. Being \"born again\" doesn't refer to the physical rebirth, but the spiritual rebirth, and doesn't refer to reincarnation. God will not allow sin in his presence, so we must be washed clean by the blood of Jesus, only accessible through water baptism, not through the \"Sinner's Prayer\" or anything else not specified in the Word of God.",

Traditionally, beet juice provided the pink color; so little is needed that the flavor of the drink remains largely unchanged. This beverage may have originated as a replacement for \"Indian lemonade,\" a cold infusion of red sumac berries, sometimes sweetened with maple sugar. Sumac beverages have a taste and appearance similar to pink lemonade, and were popular with Native Americans and early European settlers.",

You don't need to tell them how easy it was to make. Just smile and let them exalt you.. . A Many-Splendored Bird. Roasting a chicken takes a little longer than some other methods of cooking this universally popular bird, but it actually requires very little preparation time-it's mostly just a matter of patience in waiting for the bundle of joy to finish roasting. Another merit of roast chicken is that the leftovers just keep on giving. Roasting two chickens is just as easy as roasting one chicken, and today's roast chicken dinner is tomorrow's chicken enchiladas, chicken soup, chicken salad, chicken fettuccine Alfredo, or chicken sandwich. As if that weren't enough, roast chicken is wonderfully economical, too! Pound for pound, whole chickens are much cheaper than a package of chicken breasts, thighs, or legs.. . Skin is In. Chicken skin contains a great deal of fat, and many people are in the habit of removing it in order to avoid the extra calories. Crispy, fragrant roast chicken skin is absolutely delicious, and, many people insist, the best part of the roast chicken. If you choose to pass up the temptation, though, you still need to leave the skin on the chicken during roasting. Roasting a skinless bird is an exercise in futility. The skin holds in moisture and juiciness. If you skin the chicken before you roast it, the meat will become bone-dry long before it's cooked through. You can carve the chicken then remove the skin from your portion as you see fit. Don't worry-there is no significant difference in calories between removing the skin before or after cooking!. . Divine Brine. One secret to really flavorful, juicy roast chicken is brining-i.e., soaking in salt water. Kosher chickens are always brined before selling; this is one of the reasons that kosher birds tend to taste better. To brine a chicken, dissolve 1/2 cup kosher salt in 1/2 gallon of water, immerse the chicken in the solution and place immediately in the refrigerator. You should let it soak for at least 3 hours, but overnight is great too. When you're ready to cook the chicken, pour out the brine, rinse the chicken cold running water so it won't taste excessively salty, then pat it dry with paper towels. You can still achieve a delicious roast chicken even without brining, but do give it a try sometime. You'll love the results.. . Dress it Up. If you decide to forego the brining step, just remove the chicken from the package, rinse it with cool water, and then pat it dry with paper towels. Rinsing removes residue and some surface bacteria, and drying off the chicken ensures that the skin will brown. Now for the fun part: seasoning! A chicken roasted with nothing but salt, pepper, and butter is very tasty indeed, but it's also easy to build on top of these simple flavors. Herbs are always a good idea. You can chop them up and tuck them under the chicken's skin along with a few pats of butter, or you can simply stuff handfuls of them into the chicken cavity. Wedges of aromatic fruits such as lemons or oranges, and aromatic vegetables such as onions and garlic are great to stuff in with the herbs as well. Filling the cavity with good-smelling things will perfume the bird as it roasts, infusing the meat with incomparable flavor.. . Another approach you can use is to make a blend of dried or fresh ground spices and rub them under the chicken's skin and inside the cavity. For a Southwestern flavor, try chile powder or pureed fresh chiles, cumin, and sage. For an Indian-inspired bird,",

It is very rich and delicious, and is best served with rice pilaf and steamed garlic broccoli.. . 4 whole chicken breasts, halved. Salt & freshly ground black pepper. 5 tbsp. unsalted butter. 1/2 c. cognac. 3 tbsp. unbleached all-purpose flour. 2 tsp. dried tarragon. 3 1/2 c. non vintage champagne. 1/2 c. heavy or whipping cream. . Sprinkle the chicken breast with salt and pepper. Melt the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven over medium high heat. Brown the chicken breasts, a few at a time, on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.. . Pour cognac into the pan, warm it and flame with a match. When the flames subside, stir in the flour and tarragon. Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in 3 cups of champagne. Return the chicken to the pan. Cover and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove the chicken to a warmed serving platter. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of champagne and the cream. Cook the sauce over high heat until reduced and slightly thickened. Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve immediately. Serves 6.. . EDIT-CIty Girl is full of bologna.  You don't need some fancy spice needle to have flavorful chicken.  Use vinegars, broth, or wines along with plenty of spices.  Try cutting your chicken into smaller pieces, particularly with breasts.  I usually fillet them because they are so incredibly thick.  The thinner they are, the quicker and better they absorb the flavor!!",

So, ultimately, I can only look to Dutch countries or historical data and conclude that Muslim comunities are horribly crime ridden. Consider the recent earthquakes in Pakistan. You could watch Muslin looters and criminals on TV. It took a long time to get in hand.. . But I think the crime your referrring to is Islamic war and terror. Almost all armed conflict worldwide is Islamic. Worse still, historically, Muslims have committed the worlds greatest genocides. Just the hindu genocides alone total in the hundreds of milllions, and that was with swords and fire!. . Slavery ofcourse is a great crime and Muslims are BY FAR HISTORIES GREATEST SLAVE TRADERS.

Anxiety is a complex combination of the feeling of fear, apprehension and worry often accompanied by physical sensations such as palpitations, chest pain and/or shortness of breath. It may exist as a primary brain disorder or may be associated with other medical problems including other psychiatric disorders.. . 2) Depression:. Depression (mood)  . Depression, in everyday language, refers to any downturn in mood, which may be relatively transitory and perhaps due to something trivial. This is differentiated from clinical depression which is marked by symptoms that last two weeks or more and are so severe that they interfere with daily living.. In the field of psychiatry the word depression can also have this meaning but more specifically refers to a mental illness when it has reached a severity and duration to warrant a diagnosis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) states that a depressed mood is often reported as being: \"... depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps'.\". .  Depression (geology)  . Depression in geology is a landform sunken or depressed below the surrounding area. Depressions may be formed by various mechanisms, and may be referred to by a variety of technical terms.. . Depression (economics)  . In economics, a depression is a term commonly used for a sustained downturn in the economy. It is more severe than a recession (which is seen as a normal downturn in the business cycle). Considered a rare but extreme form of recession, the start of a depression is characterised by unusual increases in unemployment, restriction of credit, shrinking output and investment, price deflation or hyperinflation, numerous bankruptcies, reduced amounts of trade and commerce, as well as violent currency devaluations. Unlike a recession, there is no official definition for a depression, even though some have been proposed. Generally it is marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced given current resources and technology (potential output). One could say that while a recession refers to the economy \"falling down,\" a depression is a matter of \"not being able to get up.\" . . Depression (meteorology)  . A depression (also called a 'low') is an area of low pressure caused by rising air.. This is opposite to an anti-cyclone which is an area of high pressure.",

Everyone experiences some anxiety even on a daily basis but people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) experience constant anxiety which often has no apparent cause. GAD may be mild and manageable, but, for some people, it is debilitating. It can also cause and/or aggravate additional health problems, both physical and psychological.. . People with GAD often worry about the same problems everyone worries about - money, health, families, jobs, etc. The problem is, people with GAD worry excessively and constantly. People without GAD have the ability to put normal worries on hold and focus on daily activity. People with GAD are often distracted by their worries and find it difficult to think about anything else.. . Many people with GAD also feel constant anxiety with no apparent cause. They wake up feeling anxious and can never pinpoint a direct cause. The anxiety never seems to disappear throughout the day.. . \"Unfortunately, most people with GAD assume that they are just a 'nervous person' and that nothing can be done. They do not usually seek treatment unless their anxiety is complicated by depression, panic attacks or alcoholism. With appropriate treatment, however, GAD sufferers can feel less anxious and function better.\" -- Deborah Cowley, MD, in Psychopharmacology. . The cause of GAD has yet to be determined, and there is probably more than one possible cause. GAD appears to run in families, so there is probably a genetic factor. A major traumatic or stressful event may sometimes trigger GAD. Another theory is that the person with GAD has internal conflicts which have yet to be resolved. GAD may begin in childhood or later in life. Most likely, GAD has both physiological and psychological components.. . Generalized anxiety disorder is a relatively common anxiety problem, affecting 3-4% of the population, that turns daily life into a state of worry, anxiety, and fear. Excessive thinking and dwelling on the \"what ifs\" characterizes this anxiety disorder. As a result, the person feels there\u2019s no way out of the vicious cycle of anxiety and worry, and then becomes depressed about life and the state of anxiety they find themselves in.. . Generalized anxiety usually does not cause people to avoid situations, and there isn\u2019t an element of a \"panic attack\" involved in the prognosis, either. It\u2019s the thinking, thinking, thinking, dwelling, dwelling, ruminating, ruminating, and inability to shut the mind off that so incapacitates the person. At other times, thoughts seem almost non-existent because the anxious feelings are so dominant. Feelings of worry, dread, lack of energy, and a loss of interest in life are common. Many times there is no \"trigger\" or \"cause\" for these feelings and the person realizes these feelings are irrational. Nevertheless, the feelings are very real. At this point, there is no \"energy\" or \"zest\" in life and no desire to want to do much.. . This emotional fear and worry can be quite strong. If a loved one is ten minutes late, the person with generalized anxiety fears the very worst -- something\u2019s dreadfully wrong (after all, they\u2019re ten minutes late!), there\u2019s been an accident, the paramedics are taking the person to the hospital and his injuries are just too critical to resuscitate him.....\"Oh, my God!.....WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?\" Feelings of fear and anxiety rush in from these thoughts, and the vicious cycle of anxiety and depression runs wild.. . Some people with generalized anxiety have fluctuations in mood from hour to hour, whereas others have \"good days\" and \"bad days\". Others do better in the morning, and others find it easier at the end of the day. These anxiety feelings and moods feed on themselves, leading",

This can be repeated until ejaculation is desired. The stop and start method can be used with the squeeze method as well.. . Desensitizing Creams for premature ejaculation. Creams can be used to desensitize the end of the penis. They act like a local or tropical anesthetic. Thicker condoms (or two condoms) can also desensitize by decreasing sensitivity and therefore stimulation, thus prolonging the sexual act.. . More Foreplay prevents premature ejaculation. Stimulate your partner to a state of high arousal before you have your genitals touched, that way ejaculation and orgasm can be achieved about the same time.. . Masturbation to prevent premature ejaculation. Practice different methods by yourself. Getting to know your feelings and sensations gives you the chance to gain confidence.. . Remember getting good at sex and overcoming premature ejaculation can take a bit of time. Practice makes perfect. If you find that things are not improving then help is available from sex therapists who are experts in this field.",

            "passage": "Premature ejaculation occurs when you ejaculate too quickly and without control. It occurs before or shortly after penetration. Premature ejaculation interferes with the sexual pleasure of both you and your partner. It causes feelings of guilt,embarrassment, frustration, and depression. Premature ejaculation will cause stress in even the healthiest relationship.. . The Cause of Severe Premature Ejaculation.. . 1. Extreme levels of arousal caused by the overproduction of sex hormones. Simply stated - Hormones control \"everything\" that happens during a sexual performance - from the erection to the ejaculation!. . A normal ejaculation occurs when sexual excitement triggers glands, located inside your body, to begin a slow release of chemicals (hormones) into your blood stream. The slow release of these hormones tells your brain to gently stimulate the nerves at the glans (head of your penis). As you become more and more sexually excited, your body produces more and more of these hormones. The sensitivity becomes greater and greater until you reach the point at which time you ejaculate. Under normal circumstances the production of hormone is gradual and a man has the ability to control the sensations of sex.. . Premature Ejaculation occurs when your body produces too much hormone too fast. Your body becomes \"over stimulated\". The head of the penis becomes so sensitive that you ejaculate almost immediately. There is absolutely no control.. . This Extreme Sensitivity on the head of your penis causes the ejaculatory mechanism, inside your body, to go into \"spasms\". It's these spasms that cause the overpowering Urge to Ejaculate. The head of your penis becomes so sensitive and the urge is so strong that you ejaculate immediately.. If you slow down the production of excess hormone - you slow down the ejaculation.. . In fact, there's NO product, exercise, or technique that can stop severe premature ejaculation when used alone. NONE! Severe premature ejaculation is an extremely complex condition the causes of premature ejaculation are both physical and psychological. To cure premature ejaculation requires a combination of products that simultaneously attack and eliminate each cause. Only Last-Longer has a combination of products strong enough to eliminate ALL aspects of both the physical and psychological causes of premature ejaculation.. Quite often, when a man gains good ejaculatory control, he suddenly becomes much more interested in sex. And even if he doesn't, it might be nicer for both of you if he lasted longer.. . Faced with involuntary ejaculation, most men try to distract themselves during intercourse, believing that by thinking about other things, they can trick themselves into lasting longer. Usually, that only makes things worse.. . Don't tune out your body. TUNE INTO IT. You need to become more familiar with your different levels of sexual arousal. You also need to recognize how you feel as you approach your point of ejaculatory inevitability, the \"point of no return.\" Once you recognize how you feel close to your point of no return, it's not difficult to make small sexual adjustments that allow you to remain highly aroused without ejaculating.. . Sexual arousal is a four-phase process. In the Excitement Phase, breathing deepens and erection begins. In the Plateau Stage, erection becomes full and you feel highly aroused. When arousal builds to a certain point, the next phase occurs, Orgasm with Ejaculation. Then during the Resolution Phase, breathing returns to normal and erection subsides. The key to ejaculatory control is to extend the Plateau Phase, to maintain arousal without triggering Orgasm and Ejaculation.. . If you want to learn ejaculatory control:",

The standard deviation is an important concept in statistics because it is a precise indicator of the degree of variability within a set of numbers. A set with a smaller standard deviation consists of more closely bunched numbers than a set with a larger standard deviation. If the test scores of a class were 76, 80, 82, 85, and 91, for example, the standard deviation would be about 5.04, reflecting the fact that the scores are fairly close together. A class with the wildly varying test scores 0, 53, 77, 91, and 100, however, would have a standard deviation of about 35.8.. . The standard deviation of a set of numbers is calculated using the deviation of individual numbers from the set\u2019s mean. Each deviation is found by subtracting the number from the mean. If there are n members in a set and the deviations of the members from the mean are symbolized by x1 through xn, the standard deviation (\u03c3) is given by the formula: .  . . . To compute the standard deviation of the set {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}, for example, first find the mean. The mean is the sum of all the members of a set divided by the number of members of the set: (2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 9)/5 = 25/5 = 5. The individual deviations from the mean are 5 \u2013 2 = 3, 5 \u2013 3 = 2, 5 \u2013 5 = 0, 5 \u2013 6 = -1, and 5 - 9 = -4. Square the individual deviations and add them together: 32 + 22 + 02 + (-1)2 + (-4)2 = 9 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 16 = 30. Divide the result by the number of members of the set: 30/5 = 6. Take the square root and round to two decimal places: \u221a6 = 2.45. The standard deviation of {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}, therefore, is 2.45.. . This equation works for sets in which all members are specified. A more complex equation is necessary to determine the standard deviation of a set using only a sample of that set\u2019s elements.. . OR:. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of dispersion: a statistical measure of the amount by which a set of values differs from the arithmetical mean, equal to the square root of the mean of the differences' squares",

            "passage": "(from Ferdinand Petiot) . The most commonly accepted theory is that the Bloody Mary was born at Harry's American Bar in Paris in the 1920s, spurred by the arrival of the first tins of tomato juice from the United States, according to Dale DeGroff in \"The Craft of the Cocktail\" (Clarkson Potter, $35, 230 pages). Vodka was relatively new in Paris at the time, thanks to Russian emigres fleeing the Bolshevik revolution, and bartenders were mixing it with just about anything. . . The man credited with the drink's invention is Harry's bartender Ferdinand Petiot. When Petiot crossed the Atlantic in the 1930s to run the King Cole Bar in the St. Regis Hotel in New York City, he made a few changes to his creation. He used gin, according to DeGroff, because vodka was not yet available in the United States. And he renamed the drink the Red Snapper because the term \"Bloody Mary\" wasn't deemed acceptable at the time. When the drink flipped back to vodka, it resumed its original name. . . That name may have blue-blooded roots (the English Tudor queen) or a more blue-collar origin (a Harry's regular named Mary). Another theory appeared in The Chronicle's 1975 obituary for Petiot: An American entertainer who sampled the cocktail at Harry's said it reminded him of a Chicago club called the Bucket of Blood. . . Over time, the basic recipe has evolved to include vodka, tomato juice, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, lime or lemon juice, celery salt and black pepper, with Tabasco sauce optional. Just as coffee can run the gamut from black to caramel-mocha-frappa-whappa, the Bloody Mary is prone to variation. These include the Bloody Caesar (made with clam juice), Bloody Maria (tequila), Bloody Bull (beef bouillon), and others made with beer and sake.",

            "passage": "Bloody Mary: The Unauthorized Biography. Controversy and intrigue are just two of the ingredients that go into this classic cocktail. Al Martinez spills the story..  .  . RELATED LINK:A Better Bloody.  To sip a Bloody Mary in New York's St. Regis Hotel is to be in the presence of a greater power. Not God, but Fernand \"Pete\" Petiot, who, it is said, invented what was to become America's favorite morning-after drink, the hangover remedy, the compelling and infamous hair of the dog. . . I sat in the very room, the King Cole Bar, where Pete and the Bloody were introduced to America in the 1930s. While not quite a cathedral, it is nonetheless a lounge of exquisite secular taste, enclosed in the comfort of dark wood and dominated by a large mural of the merry old soul himself, surrounded by an entourage from the lyrical world of the nursery rhyme.. . According to drinking lore, encapsulated in Christopher O'Hara's book The Bloody Mary (with William Nash photographs of such glory that you want to drink the pages), the Bloody was invented by bartender Petiot at Harry's New York Bar in Paris. The basic recipe consisted of vodka, tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne pepper.. . Legend has it that he named it after Queen Mary Tudor, or Bloody Mary, the Catholic daughter of Henry VIII, who, during her five-year reign, managed to kill off an impressive number of Protestants. Even by the standards of 16th-century England, the slaughter of some 300 \"heretics\" seemed excessive.. . Others ascribe the name to a bar in Chicago called \"Bucket of Blood,\" and still others believe it was based on the complaints of a London visitor to Harry's Bar who kept drinking Petiot's tomato juice libation while going on about his wife, Mary. Using one of England's most popular adjectives, the man declared his wife was a bloody nag and bloody impossible, among other bloody evils. So Petiot, in a fit of whimsy, named his drink the Bloody Mary. You can believe any bloody story you like, but most seem to prefer the influence of the bloody Queen.. . However, for those who cant toward a good scare, there is the urban legend of a woman named Mary who was injured in an accident that tore her face so badly she bled to death. Her spirit is said to roam about, and if you stand before a mirror and say Bloody Mary three times, her mangled visage will appear. If so, dash for the door or she'll rip you up, too. You'll surely need a drink after that.. . To continue the more likely tale, John Jacob Astor fell in love with the Bloody at Harry's, and brought Petiot and his drink to The St. Regis, which the Astors owned. Word of its existence spread like a dirty joke, and in no time at all, the Bloody became a standard morning-after libation and, later, one of the drinks favored at a modern invention called brunch, leading it to become at one time the third most popular cocktail in the country. Fearful that the name might offend, however, the Astors renamed it the Red Snapper. But that, forgive me, lacked the snap of the original and ended up in the barrel of bad ideas, where the mango Martini and the Pet Rock reside.. . There are as many ways to prepare a Bloody Mary as there are to cook potatoes. King Cole bartender Gavin Fitzgibbon, himself somewhat of a cocktail historian, assured me that his Bloody was concocted with the same recipe created by Petiot. \"We do not,\" he proclaimed in the grand style of a purist, \"attempt to popularize it.\" Unlike those days in Paris, however, the drink at The St. Regis sells for $17, and while it is a very nice drink, it is not worth three times the price of the taxi that took me to the hotel in the first place.. . In quest of the elusive queen of Bloodies, I tasted samples in such diverse venues as a noisy singles joint called Gladstone's on an L.A. beach, Melrose Place's four-star Bastide, and the elegant Bull and",

We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms.\". .

Several fictional characters are also called Bloody Mary. . In folklore and children's street culture, \"Bloody Mary\" is the name of a children's game in which a ghost or witch of the same name (or sometimes other names, such as Mary Worth) is said to appear in a mirror when summoned. One of the more common ways participants attempt to make her appear is to stand before a mirror in the dark and repeat her name three times, though there are many variations. Some include chanting a hundred times, chanting at midnight, spinning around, or rubbing one's eyes. Most of these are meant to disorient people. In some versions of the legend, the summoner must say \"Bloody Mary, I killed your son!\" (or \"I killed your baby\"). In these variants, Bloody Mary is often believed to be the spirit of a mother (often a widow) who murdered her children, or a woman who was murdered shortly before or after her wedding. In stories where Mary is supposed to have been wrongly accused of killing her children, the querent might say \"I believe in Mary Worth.\" This is similar to another game involving the summoning of The Bell Witch in a mirror at midnight. Similar rituals are also used to summon spirits in the movies Beetlejuice (1988) and Candyman (1992). The game is often a test of courage, as it is said that if Bloody Mary is summoned, she would murder the summoner, often in a quite violent way, such as gouging out his or her eyes. Other variations say that the querent must not look directly at her, but at her image in the mirror; she will then reveal the querent's future, particularly concerning marriage and children.. . Bloody Mary Worth is typically described as a child-murderess who lived in the locality where the legend has taken root about a century ago. There is often a specific local graveyard or tombstone that becomes attached to the legend.. . On the other hand, various people have surmised that the lore about taunting Bloody Mary about her baby may relate her tenuously to folklore about Queen Mary I. ([1], [2]) The queen's life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies. Had Mary I successfully borne a child, this would have established a Roman Catholic succession and threatened the continuance of her religious persecutions after her death. Speculation exists that the miscarriages were deliberately induced. As a result, some retellings of the tale make Bloody Mary the queen driven to madness by the loss of her children. ([3]) It is likely, however, that Queen Mary I provided only her nickname to the Bloody Mary of folklore.. . She is also confused in some tellings of the story with Mary Queen of Scots. Bloody Mary is sometimes said to have bathed in the blood of her child victims in order to retain a youthful complexion; this would appear to confound her with Elizabeth B\u00e1thory.. . The mirror ritual by which Bloody Mary is summoned may also relate to a form of divination involving mirrors and darkness that was once performed on Halloween. While as with any sort of folklore the details may vary, this particular tale encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant, of course, that they were destined to die before they married.",

Once your oil or grease is heated and ready slowly put battered chicken in the frying pan and once the firat side has cooked, turn the temperature down to medium or medium-high. Finish cooking the rest of the chicken and make sure to periodically check the chicken to make sure it is fully cooked meaning not bleeding or no red areas in the chicken. You could also use Fish Fry batter instead of adding ingredients. For spicy chicken add curry, red peppers, chilli powder, crushed jalapenos in batter or tabasco sauce while cooking. There is also a hot sauce called Spontaneous Combustion. This stuff will make any food very hot. You may not be able to finish it because your mouth is on fire.",

Haven't you seen words and phrases, names even, that are used in normal newspapers, magazine articles, and books?  People say things like \"I'll go get a Coke.\"  If it was illegal to use a trademarked name in that way, we'd never be able to say anything!  . . The basic rule in copyright is that if the ideas are, to your conscious mind, original to you, go ahead and use them.  If you purposely quote someone else, put it in quote marks and attribute it.  But if you just happen to choose the same words someone else in the past has used, that would not be an infringement.  However, if your entire chapter (or even a significant part of it) is word-for-word the same as someone else's, you're going to have trouble convincing a jury that you did not copy.. . Mama always said if you are honest, you don't have to worry about being sued.  That's something of an exaggeration in this modern litigious age, but it's about as good as we've got.

I like to get the basic training done without all the extra distractions.  Once the basics are installed it is wise to go to different places so that the footing is different.  Like a walk down a side walk, walk them through a carpeted area, bare ground, think forest etc.  Also where people and other animals are so that he/she learns to be observant but will not break her training.. . If you want instructions on how to teach him/her to pull a sled start out with, say a wagon pulling a couple of kids or rocks.  I don't think this is what you were looking for cause you didn't say if you had several or just one.. . I myself like the behavior modification rather than the method training.

A good website for husky-specific training tips was mentioned above: http://www.husky-petlove.com/husky_alpha_training.html.  I tried these ideas with my dog and had great results.  . . Some tips:. Huskies cannot be trained to be off a leash.  Period.  . . If you NEVER feed your dog from the table, (s)he will NEVER beg.  . . If you limit food (most Huskies only need 1 cup of dry food twice per day, according to our vet), then you can use food as a great motivator, even if it is just a small morsel of bread or a kibble.  To train your dog to kiss with his nose, you can say \"kiss\" then physically move his nose to contact your cheek, then say \"good boy\" and give a food reward.  After about 5 of these (s)he will be trained.  . . If basic obedience is a problem, make sure you are giving your husky enough exercise.  It makes a huge difference.  . . Good luck.",

Parts of Noahs Ark have been sighted on Mount Ararat and bits of tarred gofer wood which the Ark was made from have been dated and found to be 5000 years old,this is proof that the bible is true, and there is more; Look at the Moabite Stone.The original can be seen in the Louvre Museum in Paris France. The writing tells of the rebellion of King Mesha of Moab against Israel. This  event is also reported in the Bible (2 Kings1:1:3:4-27) The Pool of Siloam and the entrance of a 1,749 foot  -long(533 meter-long)water tunnel in Jerusalem. Many modern-day visitors to Jerusalem have waded through this tunnel. It's existance is further proof that the Bible is true, The Bible explains that King Hezekiah had this tunnel built over2,500 years ago to protect his water supply from an invading army,-(2Kings20:20; 2Chronicles32:2-4,30)At the British Museum a visitor can see the Neabonidus Chronicle. It describes the fall of ancient Babylon, even as the Bible also does.(Daniel5:30,31)The Bible says that Belshazzar was then King of Babylon.  In fact, at one time all known writings said that Nabonidus was Babylon's last king. So some who said the Bible is not true claimed that Belshazzar never existed and that the Bible was wrong. But in recent years ancient writings have been found that identified Belshazzar as a son of Nabonidus and coruler with his father in Babylon at the time. Yes, the Bible really is true, as so many examples prove.Yet the Bible does not contain only true history.Everything it says is true, Even when it touches on matters of science, it is marvelously accurate. These are only some examples, but the more research you do the more you will see the truth of the Bible.",

But, I got into a Bible study, where it was from beginning to end, and it was explained to me, and now I get it.. Unless a person is open to it w/ no judgement, and they are sincere in learning, not in disproving, God will open your spirit up to Him and HIs Word, and all will make sense.. Only those who seek it sincerely, and will find God, and only those who He reveals Himself to through His Word, will truly get it.. . Read 1 Cor 2:11-16:. \"For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment: . \"For who has known the mind of the Lord .  that he may instruct him?\" But we have the mind of Christ.\". . I would reccomend if you really want to know answers and learn about Him either way, get yourself into a Bible study. . http://wec.upci.org/churches. . that will teach you the Word of God from beginning to end and you can make an educated decision on it for yourself.... But know one thing- God says in the Bible He does not want you to have \"religion\" (which is man made rules)... He wants you to have a relationship with Him!

It was not just one man sitting down and saying, I'm going to write this and everyone will believe me.  Every book in the Bible was written by a different person, and some were written by several people together.  Hense the names of the books.  e.g.the book of John, Peter, Galatians...They were named after the people that wrote them.  And since no one has exactly the same outlook on things as another person, all the details aren't exactly the same.  Let's say you and I were watching Jesus's crucifiction.  You're at the front of the crowd, throwing stones, and I'm at the back praying for Him to leave this world and join His Father.  From where you're standing, it looks one way.  But it's different where I'm at.  In the end, the simple fact is, He was still nailed to a cross and burned, along with two other men.  . . You also have to think about the language barrier.  You and I may speak English, and read our Bibles in English.  But the first Bibles were not written that way.  Every book in the Bible was written by a different person, from a different region of the world.  So, the Bible you know today has been translated and retranslated so many times, some of the words are not what they ere originally.  . . You can't expect the Bible to conform to how you think.  It was written thousands of years ago.  Things change over time.  But instead, try to put yourself in the mode of thinking that those people were in when they wrote it.  All they knew was what they saw, heard, felt, and experienced for them selves.  Than they wrote it down.  Just the same as celebrities and athletes do now.  You just have to look at it through a different pair of eyes for a little while.  Then you'll understand it.",

The problem arises when people try to force the Bible to fit their beliefs, instead of adjusting their beliefs to agree with Bible teachings.  For example, some want to say that the Bible says nothing about homosexuality because that fits their desires.  However, the Bible does indeed speak on the subject, and is consistent throughout.  When a person's beliefs go contrary to Bible teachings, what should he or she do?  Trust the Bible.. . Now, as to physical evidence...archaeologists have indeed found evidence as stated in the Bible.  In fact, there are things in the Bible that archaelogists and other scientists doubted...until they found it.  Whether it is the city of Ninevah, or certain kings stated in the Bible, to wells and other locales, the Bible has been found to be accurate.. . Your statement about evolution doesn't really hold water.  Even though bones and fossils have been found, even Darwin admitted that his theory has so many holes in it that it couldn't stand up to intense scrutiny.  The problem is that scientists refuse to apply scientific principles to their theory.  If a scientist finds data that contradicts a hypothesis, then by rights the scientist must discard the hypothesis and formulate a new one based on the new data.  However, with evolution, they refuse to discard it and instead try to force the data to fit the hypothesis.  In a way, evolution is their faith, rather than a science.. . Thus, instead of believing in \"religion\", trust in the Bible and speak with those who live their lives according to its principles, and those who are students of its teachings, rather than students of the philosophies of men.",

Mormon is a colloquial term used to refer to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement, and most commonly to the movement's original and largest group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The term is derived from The Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith claims to have translated from ancient plates containing a history of the early inhabitants of the Americas that was compiled by a prophet called Mormon. Some mainstream Christian groups consider Mormonism as a cult.",

            "passage": "References: Mormon vs Biblical Teachings about Salvation . . . Bible quotations are from the New American Standard version. For information on sources of Mormon quotations, see the section titled \"Mormon Documents\".. . . . 1. Mormons teach that salvation (exaltation) comes through faith in Christ plus baptism plus works, i.e., we must add to the work of Christ. In the Bible 'salvation' means deliverance from the consequence (eternal separation from God) of our sin. Mormon leaders have redefined the word 'salvation' to have a two-fold meaning: a) forgiveness of sins and b) universal resurrection:. . \"There will be a General Salvation for all in the sense in which that term is generally used, but salvation, meaning resurrection, is not exaltation\" (Stephen L. Richards, Contributions of Joseph Smith, LDS tract, p.5). . \"All men are saved by grace alone without any act on their part, meaning they are resurrected\" (Bruce McConkie, What Mormons Think of Christ\", LDS tract, p.28). . Thus, when a Mormon speaks of 'salvation by grace', he is usually referring to universal resurrection. Mormons use the term 'exaltation' to refer to attain a place in the highest level of heaven. The Mormon term 'exaltation' is more nearly equivalent to the Biblical term 'salvation'. What do Mormon leaders say about this?. . The Book of Mormon says of salvation: \"for we know that is is by grace that we are saved, after all that we can do\" (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 25:23). . The LDS Third Article of Faith states: \"We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" (Pearl of Great Price: Articles of Faith). . Joseph Fielding Smith explains what that last phrase means: \"that which man merits through his own acts through life and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, p.134). . James Talmage explains: \"...redemption from personal sins can only be obtained through obedience to the requirement of the Gospel, and a life of good works\" (James Talmage, in A Study of the Articles of Faith). . Spencer W. Kimball states: \"however powerful the saving grace of Christ, it brings exaltation to no man who does not comply with the works of the gospel\" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, pg. 207); \"Each command we obey sends us another rung up the ladder to perfected manhood and toward godhood; and every law disobeyed is a sliding toward the bottom where man merges into the brute world\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pg. 153); \"living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation...trying is not sufficient. Nor is repentence when one merely tries to abandon sin\" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, p.164-165, 354-355). . Bruce McConkie claimed: \"Jesus kept the commandments of his Father and thereby worked out his own salvation, and also set an example as to the way and the means whereby all men may be saved\" (The Mortal Messiah, Vol.4, p.434). . What works do they mean? Here are some:. . Baptism for the dead: \"The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead...Those saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at peril of their own salvation\" (Joseph Smith, in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p.356, 196). . Marriages sealed in the Temple: \"Marriage is not only a righteous institution, but obedience to this law [Temple marriage] is absolutely necessary in order to obtain the highest exaltation in the Kingdom of God\" (Milton R. Hunter, in Gospel Through the Ages, p.119). . Keeping the whole law: \"To enter the celestial [kingdom] and obtain exaltation, it is necessary that the whole law be kept...Do you desire to enter the celestial Kingdom and receive eternal life?",

Anybody can get strep throat, but it's most common in school-age kids and teens. It occurs most often during the school year when big groups of kids and teens are in close quarters.. .

What's the Difference Between Strep Throat and a Sore Throat?. Not all sore throats are step throats.

By the second or third day after taking antibiotics, the other symptoms should start to go away, too.. . Even though your child may not feel sick at that point, it's very important that he or she finish the antibiotic prescription. If your child stops taking antibiotics too soon, bacteria can remain in the throat and the symptoms can return.. . If your child is not treated for strep throat, he or she is most infectious when the symptoms are the most severe but could remain contagious for up to 21 days.

To prevent your sick child from spreading strep throat to others in your home, keep his or her eating utensils, dishes, and drinking glasses separate from those that everyone else is using. Wash them in hot, soapy water after each use. Also, make sure your child doesn't share food, drinks, napkins, handkerchiefs, or towels with other family members.

The tonsils have a whitish coating in at least one third of the cases. The spleen, (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest lymph node), is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the ribcage which becomes enlarged or swollen in about 50% of patients with \"mono.\" An enlarged liver may also occur. About 5% of patients have a splotchy red rash over the body, which has a similar appearance to the rash of measles. . . How is \"mono\" diagnosed? . . The diagnosis of \"mono\" is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. \"Mono\" is confirmed by blood tests while testing to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Early in the course of the illness, blood tests show an increase in a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes are unusual or \"atypical\" lymphocytes, which suggest \"mono.\" More specific testing, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of \"mono.\" These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test can reveal abnormalities in liver function. Testing to exclude the possibility of a strep throat is also considered for some patients.",

Since the end of hostilities in the 1991 Gulf War (ie, the one that started with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait), Saddam repeatedly violated the terms of the cease fire.  He routinely fired Surface to Air missiles on allied aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones (established to halt his crackdown on opposition Shiites).  I don't think you will find many conservatives alleging that Iraq attacked us on 9-11, but Iraq's continuing violation of the cease fire terms and failure to abide by UN resolutions led to the war.  In addition, Iraq harbored terrorists escaping from the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, paid \"commissions\" to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers in Israel, and met with terrorist organizations including al-quaeda on numerous occasions before we invaded Iraq.",

He grows whiskers, with more hair including pubic hair.  He will begin to think of sex and girls.  He become a lot more mature and his think is usually better than when he was a \"kid\".  I think puberty lasts until death for men.. . Lets take a woman:  She begans to grow breasts, pubic hair, have periods and her figure becomes more pronounced.  She begins to think of sex and reproduction.  She will remain this way until menopause when her periods end as does her child bearing.

It usually takes place between the ages of 10 and 15 in both sexes but sometimes occurs as early as 7 or 8 years of age in females. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that stimulate enlargement and development of the sex organs, which thus become capable of reproduction. The appearance of secondary sex characteristics also occurs during puberty. In females the reproductive cycle of ovulation and menstruation begins, pubic hair appears, and development of the breasts and other body contours takes place. Physical changes in males include production and discharge of semen, appearance of facial and body hair, and deepening of the voice. Skin difficulties, such as acne, may affect both sexes. Puberty, a transition period coinciding with adolescence, involves both physiological and psychological adjustments. It is often marked by emotional stress arising as the adolescent relinquishes childhood behavior patterns and adopts those of an adult.. . AND BOYS DO NOT HAVE PUBERTY BECAUSE ONLY GIRLS DOES",

            "passage": "Rape is about power not sex. This is the first misconception about rape. It is about dominance and control. Men rape women, and other men, and children. Women can rape, but statistics are not very high. Rape does not have to be anal or vaginal penetration, it can be oral and any behaviour in which the survivor of the rape did not consent to. This means that rape can and does happen in marriage. Women are more likely to be raped by people they know, as opposed to strangers.. Rape is about power, not sex. A rapist uses actual force or violence - or the threat of it - to take control over another human being. Some rapists use drugs to take away a person's ability to fight back. Rape is a crime, whether the person committing it is a stranger, a date, an acquaintance, or a family member.. . No matter how it happened, rape is frightening and traumatizing. People who have been raped need care, comfort, and a way to heal.. . Why Does it Happen?. . Let's look at sexual stereotyping and how males and females talk to each other. . . Although things are changing, society still frequently encourages men to be competitive and aggressive and teaches women to be passive and avoid confrontation. . Men say they misunderstand a woman's words and actions \u2014 the excuse \"she said no, but meant yes.\" . Some people \u2014 men and women alike \u2014 still believe that it's okay for a man to demand sex if he takes a woman out or buys her gifts, and that it's not rape if he forces sex on a woman who previously had sex with him or other men. . Women also feel that if they've previously had sex with their boyfriend and he later forces her to have sex against her will, it may not be considered rape. . . Date rape can happen in homosexual relationships as well as heterosexual ones. Although it is less frequent, men can also be the victim of rape. It is still a crime and the victim still needs to get medical attention and counseling as soon as possible.. . Rape is the sexual expression of. hostility and aggression - a behavioral act not a psychiatric. condition. Rape typically reflects deep seated feelings of. inadequacy. . . Men rape because they believe they have the right to control and to punish women who do not obey their rules of behaviour. Rape is an expression of unequal power relations between men and women. Such unequal power relations are not the result of nature or evolution but societies which, through legislation and social custom, have made women second-class citizens.. . .  In our culture sex is so interfused with violence that powerlessness and power themselves have become eroticized. Getting at the real motives of rapists is difficult since they typically do not admit their crimes. Experts say rapists are notoriously manipulative and don't always tell the truth.",

Although its motion is not readily apparent, the entire galaxy is rotating about the Milky Way's center. Relative to the universe, the galaxy is moving at a speed of c.370 mi per sec (c.590 km per sec) in the same direction that the constellation Leo lies relative to the earth; it is also moving at c.60 mi per sec (c.100 km per sec) relative to the center of mass of the local group of galaxies. The sun, traveling at a speed of c.150 mi per sec (c.240 km per sec) in a nearly circular orbit, takes 200\u2013230 million years to complete one revolution.. Visual Characteristics of the Milky Way. . Among the constellations the Milky Way passes through are Carina, Crux (the Southern Cross), Sagittarius (where it is brightest), Scorpius, Aquila, Cygnus, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, and Gemini. In the direction of Cygnus is the Great Rift, a band of dark matter that lies along the Milky Way, dividing it into two forks. Another dark region is the Coalsack, in Crux. Once believed to be vast empty regions in space, these dark areas are now known to be clouds of dark matter blotting out the light behind them. Such nonluminous clouds of dust and gas, called dark nebulae, obscure many parts of the sky from sight; in the direction of the galactic center, the view is almost entirely obscured.. . Size and Shape of the Milky Way. . The Milky Way is a large galaxy comprising an estimated 200 billion stars (some estimates range as high as 400 billion) arrayed in the form of a disk, with a central elliptical bulge (some 12,000 light-years in diameter) of closely packed stars lying in the direction of Sagittarius. It is surrounded by a flat disk marked by six spiral arms\u2014four major and two minor\u2014which wind out from the nucleus like a giant pinwheel. Because of these arms, the Milky Way was classified as a spiral galaxy. However, increasing evidence indicates that the Milky Way probably has a bar or barlike structure of new, bright stars in its central region. This would modify its classification to a barred spiral or an intermediate type between barred and \u201cnormal\u201d spiral. Our sun is situated in one of the smaller arms, called the Local or Orion Arm, that connect the more substantial next inner arm and the next outer arm. The sun lies roughly two thirds of the way from the center of the disk, which is some 28,000 light-years distant, and in the galactic plane. When we look in the plane of the disk we see the combined light of its stars as the Milky Way. The diameter of the disk is c.100,000 light-years; its average thickness is 10,000 light-years, increasing to 30,000 light-years at the nucleus.. . Certain features of the region near the sun suggested that our galaxy resembles the Andromeda Galaxy. In 1951 a group led by William Morgan detected evidence of spiral arms in Orion and Perseus. Another bright arm stretches from Sagittarius to Carina in the southern sky. With the development of radio astronomy, scientists have extended a nearly complete map of the spiral structure of the galaxy by tracing regions of hydrogen that dominate the spiral arms.. . Surrounding the galaxy is a large spherical halo of globular star clusters that extends to a diameter of about 130,000 light-years; this is called the stellar halo. The galaxy also has a vast outer spherical region called the corona, or dark halo, which is as much as 600,000 light years in diameter and, in addition to dark matter which accounts for most of the Milky Way's mass, includes some distant globular clusters, the two nearby galaxies called the Magellanic clouds, and four smaller galaxies.. . Stellar Populations and Galactic Evolution. . The stars, gas, and dust that make up the Milky Way can be grouped into two broad stellar populations that suggest",

So in the grand scheme of things we shouldn't be so serious all the time...yet for our brief moments on this earth so many suffer that it becomes necessary to be serious. So within the scope of a few years time we need to be serious and take the hardship of man seriously. Life appears to be the cheapest commodity on earth. For every soul lost there are a dozen more souls to take its place. So should we care? Should we be serious about all those strangers a thousand miles away who are not related to us? Yes, only if you take your own existence seriously can you value those others. In the US we make such a noise about one life lost in a robbery or a car wreck. We show the grief of parents over a lost child. But remember that those lost lives far away are also precious to those few whose lives they touched. . . So, do we need to lighten up or maybe take ourselves a little more seriously? The universe doesn't care about us, only we can care about us.",

Despite this perfect execution, it will not ammount to much change  in Iraq.  40 people were killed and 120 people wounded yesterday despite the actions against Zaraqawi.  . . The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . .

It's really unfair and incorrect to suggest that all of the monotheistic faiths have \"caused nothing but harm to everyone in and around it.\". . A small example: You probably could kiss modern science goodbye as you know it, if it wasn't for the Christians who believed God had placed intrinsic order in the universe that they could discover. Many of the major scientists 200-300 years ago that started the ball rolling believed in God.. . And many of the men who founded the United States were also firm believers. Some were more \"deistic\" (God exists but is detached from humanity and not entirely personal) in nature, but these are only two major contributions of believers in the faith(s) you're putting down. . . That being said, religion has been abused for centuries, as long as man has had it. Any belief system can be abused, especially one that believes that some things are right and other things are wrong. (And the only systems that can't cause damage are those that have no absolute values to exploit -- so they don't do much anyway.). . And there's a lot of garbage going on in our culture right now, regarding religious people who use religion as a means to  control others rather than serve them. So that's frustrating for everyone. . . But I think that's more a problem with the people, than with the belief system(s).",

How many wars were started due to religion?  Think back thousands of years.  Thousands died in the Crusades for this very same reason.  There will always be conflict and hatred when it comes to religion.  There will always be people threatening each other.  There will always be violence.  The cause of the conflict, a lot of the time, is one religion or culture feeling they are superior above others.  If we can just learn acceptance, think where we would be.",

The easy target is people of the same kind and direct the outrage and distrust towards \"them\".  I don't advocate that, just trying to analyze why you may have that perception.. . You don't see/hear much \"hatred\" toards folks like Hindus, Budists and other religions.

Astronauts strap themselves to bike machines and excerize for hours daily when in space to maintain at the same health they'd be if they were on Earth not excercizing at all. If they fail to keep their muscles and bones active, they can experience painful damage to the muscles and even early signs of osteoperosis, the deterioration of bone mass that people on earth experience when they don't have enough calcuim, which can lead to injuring the bone. However, the excercise is easily enough done that maintaining gravity inside spacecraft is not an issue.",

Or maybe you wonder why your granddad has a full head of silver hair when in old pictures it used to be dark brown? Getting gray, silver, or white hair is a natural part of growing older, and here's why.. . Each hair on our heads is made up of two parts:. . a shaft - the colored part we see growing out of our heads . a root - the bottom part, which keeps the hair anchored under the scalp. The root of every strand of hair is surrounded by a tube of tissue under the skin that is called the hair follicle (say: fah-lih-kul). Each hair follicle contains a certain number of pigment cells. These pigment cells continuously produce a chemical called melanin (say: meh-luh-nin) that gives the growing shaft of hair its color of brown, blonde, red, and anything in between. . . Melanin is the same stuff that makes our skin's color fair or darker. It also helps determine whether a person will burn or tan in the sun. The dark or light color of someone's hair depends on how much melanin each hair contains.. . As we get older, the pigment cells in our hair follicles gradually die. When there are fewer pigment cells in a hair follicle, that strand of hair will no longer contain as much melanin and will become a more transparent color - like gray, silver, or white - as it grows. As people continue to get older, fewer pigment cells will be around to produce melanin. Eventually, the hair will look completely gray. . . People can get gray hair at any age. Some people go gray at a young age - as early as when they are in high school or college - whereas others may be in their 30s or 40s before they see that first gray hair. How early we get gray hair is determined by our genes. This means that most of us will start having gray hairs around the same age that our parents or grandparents first did. . . Gray hair is more noticeable in people with darker hair because it stands out, but people with naturally lighter hair are just as likely to go gray. From the time a person notices a few gray hairs, it may take more than 10 years for all of that person's hair to turn gray. . . Some people think that a big shock or trauma can turn a person's hair white or gray overnight, but scientists don't really believe that this happens. Just in case, try not to freak out your parents too much. You don't want to be blamed for any of their gray hairs",

In modern times, Jews were able to develop the State of Israel into a modern democratic nation offering the world advancements in medicine, technology and agriculture. Meanwhile Arabs, in their 20+ countries, continue to live under oppressive dictators as they always have. They are jelous, and jelously in Arab culture is experienced as Shame.

Nevertheless, the Middle East situation is the key background info that most Americans do not really appreciate:  I recommend the Academy Award Winning movie Lawrence of Arabia for a better understanding of why we Americans have so many enemies in the Arab world.. . OK:  your question is both incredibly stupid and, when looked at deeper, incredibly deep and important.. . First, let's get incredibly stupid out of the way.  Since both the Arabs and the Jews but especially the Arabs are guilty of murder in that part of the world,  the question is definitely stupid . . . HOWEVER . . . .. . What most Americans do NOT realize is where all that Arab hate came from.  Let me explain that hate:  visually!!!  I live in Colorado, and in case you haven't looked at a map recently, Colorado is one of the largest states among the 50.  Eighth largest between larger Nevada and smaller Oregon.  So if you're looking at a map of the western USA and see the Rocky Mountains running north to south through Colorado, imagine everything 69 miles east of the Rockies being taken away from the Colorado people and given to another group and the name of that place being changed to \"New Israel.\"  I think you can guarantee that for untold history, the former inhabitants would hate and resent all the occupants of New Israel.  That's exactly what was done in 1947 when Israel was created out of Arab land.  Jews had not lived in that area in any significant numbers for many long centuries, but out of guilt for not having done anything sooner (Hitler began tormenting German Jews as early as 1933) Europe and the USA eventually stood behind the Jewish state.  That's where the hate comes from and that's why the hate will not end ever.. .   If you also watch Lawrence of Arabia, you'll see that the lies of the British and French to the Arabs were about like the promises of the White legislators to the Indians during America's westward expansion.  That's why we are so mistrusted because we aligned ourselves always with the British.. .   So, stupid question but the hate beneath it, needs to be understood.",

An ideal Pit Bull will not do more than that, but are certainly effective.  You don't want a \"maneater\"!. . Creat the bond, forget aggressiveness and more importantly read up on the breed.  Unfortunately, too many people acquire Pit Bulls without truly understanding the breed itself.  They are the most loving, entertaining, loyal and respectful animals that I have had the pleasure of raising.. . Good luck to you and your dog.",

Robbers usually know if there is a dog there and will come prepared to eliminate any threat posed by the dog (ie they neutralize the dog with mace, bludgeoning, etc.) or trick it into one room with food and lock it in there and still take your stuff.  I know you want to protect your stuff but you are much better off having a better alarm system or locks or living in a safer part of town.. .

The reality is that most women who have period problems usually have one of two issues.  1.) low body fat  or 2.) low fat consumption.  Hormones are made by fats ingested in the body.  If the wrong type or amount of fats are being ingested, then the body has a hard time regulating the hormones produced.  In addition often times severe stress will cause this as the hormone precursors are pushed into what is known as the adrenal cascade - this is where the body uses the hormone precursors usually used for estrogen and progesterone and begins using them to assist with stress managment hormones.  . . A simple adrenal stess profile - a urinalysis any doctor can order, but usually not done by any one other than a doc practicing functinal medicine - will let you know how your hormones are working.  . . Regardless - if it is a fat intake problem - I would recommend supplementing the diet with some fish oil (if not preg.) or with flax seed oil.  Both are wonderful for a host of conditions and support normal hormone production.. . As always, a non-expensive, simple blood test by any doc can rule out the more serious issues - and they should be ruled out.. . Best of luck",

Think of how much a pain in the butt having your period is... cramps, headaches, possiblities of \"accidents\", having to go to work or school with it, having to run to the bathroom every couple hours to change a tampon, and just the overall feeling of \"blah\". I choose this option to go through this as little as I can. I've talked to my doctor about this and she says its completely fine to do it as long as the bc pills I'm taking are the white ones, and as long as I don't do it more then 3 months at a time. So I get my period every 3 months. Plus, I don't have the 6 day gap where I can't have sex.. . Its all a plus to me!",

Sexually transmitted diseases, commonly called STDs, are infections that are spread by having sex with someone who has an STD. You can get a sexually transmitted disease from sexual activity that involves the mouth, anus or vagina.. . STDs are serious illnesses that require treatment, regardless of whether or not you are pregnant. But, when you are pregnant, you are not the only one at risk; many STDs can be especially harmful to you and your baby. Some STDs, like HIV/AIDS, cannot be cured and are deadly.. . Your health care provider will likely screen for some STDs at your first prenatal visit , but if you have sex with someone who is infected, you will need to be screened at subsequent appointments and treated. If you suspect you have an STD, be sure to tell your doctor immediately. Fast treatment is the best way to protect you and your baby.. . STDs include:. .     * Herpes.     * HIV/AIDS.     * Genital warts (caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV).     * Hepatitis B.     * Chlamydia.     * Syphilis.     * Gonorrhea.     * Vaginitis . . What Are the Symptoms of STDs?. . Sometimes, there are no symptoms. If symptoms are present, they may include:. .     * Bumps, sores or warts near the mouth, anus, penis or vagina.     * Swelling or redness near the penis or vagina.     * Skin rash.     * Painful urination.     * Weight loss, loose stool, night sweats.     * Aches, pains, fever and chills.     * Yellowing of the skin (jaundice).     * Discharge from the penis or vagina (vaginal discharge may have an odor).     * Bleeding from the vagina other than during a monthly period.     * Painful sex.     * Severe itching near the penis or vagina. . How Can I Find Out If I Have an STD?. . At your prenatal visit, your health care provider will screen for a number of STDs. But, if you think you have an STD, tell your provider. He or she can examine you and perform other tests to determine if you have a sexually transmitted disease.. . How Can I Protect Myself From STDs?. . Here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting STDs:. .     * Consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent STDs..     * Use a latex condom every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant, make sure it is water-based.).     * Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have the more likely you are to catch an STD..     * Practice monogamy. This means having sex with only one person. That person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk..     * Choose your sex partners with care. Don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have an STD..     * Get checked for STDs. Don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. Just because you've been screened for STDs early on in your pregnancy, does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. If you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last STD screen, you need another set of screening tests. Also, you should be concerned if your partner is having unprotected sex with other people..     * If you have more than one sex partner, always use a condom..     * Don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. Plus, alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby..     * Know the signs and symptoms of STDs. Look for them in yourself and your sex partners..     * Learn about STDs. The more you know about STDs, the better you can protect yourself.. . How Can I Prevent Spreading a STD?. .     * Stop having sex until you see a health care provider and are treated..     * Follow your health care provider's instructions for treatment..     * Use condom",

In the sources below, I post a link to a radio documentary broadcast on BBC last weekend which I believe provides an in-depth and objective view on the topic. It's two hours and has some fluffy stuff before the programme, but well worth listening to.. . However, the media will report news. A group of Arabs sitting in a coffee shop discussing philosophy isn't news and won't get reported.. .  Agroup of muslims taking to the streets of London demanding that a cartoonist be executed for drawing some pictures is news. It also runs against the culture of fairness and free speech that is the core of our democracy - so it is certainly going to portray Islam in a bad light.. . The Western culture has a very different way of undertaking protest. It tends to be non-violent and based around debate. Yet whenever we see Islamic protests they seem to involve threats or actual violence, flag burning and intimidation.. . In the case of the London protests, these were not born out of fruistration at not being able to make a point - these were the first instincts of protest.. . You see, Islam and the Arabs have a real image problem in the West. It isn't just a problem with our media not understanding you - it is just as much about you and your media not attempting to understand us.",

Cigarettes are the same sort of thing.. . As for second hand smoke, it's all about ventilation.  Outdoors smoke dissipates, the outdoors is a natural ventilation system.  Indoors, they can put in ventilation systems that cut down on second hand smoke.  Because places like bars and restaurants are public but are also business owner's private businesses, those business owners should be allowed to decide whether or not they want to allow smoking in their business.  If an owner decides to allow smoking, then people that are paranoid that the guy smoking a cigarette with his beer is going to give them lung cancer can go somewhere else.  People should all have choices.. . Smoking bans are really a kind of tyranny imposed on smokers by the non-smoking majority.  While they might not approve of smoking, banning it is really rather cruel.  It's as if you were thirsty and had a bottle of water but were told by the government you weren't allowed to drink it.. .

The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . .

As literacy level dropped during the Dark Ages, and Latin fell out of common usage, the clergy were the only ones now with \"direct access\" to the word of god, and became incredibly powerful and rich as a result.

The most effective way to speak about the issues of eternity to a religious person is not to get sidetracked from the essentials of salvation. Upon hearing a person\u2019s background, we may feel an obligation to speak to issues such as infant baptism, transubstantiation, etc. However, it is wise rather to build on the points of agreement between the Bible and the person\u2019s denomination, such as the virgin birth, the cross, and so on. One point of agreement will almost certainly be the Ten Commandments. They are the key to bringing any religious person to a saving knowledge of the gospel. . . After someone is converted to Jesus Christ, the Bible will come alive and he will be led into all truth by the indwelling Holy Spirit. God\u2019s Word will then give him light, and he will forsake religious tradition as he is led by God. While there are strong biblical arguments that may convince unregenerate people that their church\u2019s traditions contradict Holy Scripture, there is a difficulty. Some religious people hold the teachings of their church to be on a par with, or of greater authority than, Holy Scripture. It is therefore often futile to try to convince them intellectually that their trust should be in the person of Jesus Christ, rather than in their own righteousness or in their church traditions. For this reason we should aim at the conscience, rather than the intellect. Take them through the Law of God (the Commandments) to show that they are condemned despite their works, and strongly emphasize that we are saved by grace, and grace alone, rather than by trusting in our own righteousness or religious traditions. . . If they are open to the gospel, and are interested in what God\u2019s Word says in reference to their church\u2019s teachings, they will listen to Scripture. For example, in Matthew 8:14 we see that Peter (whom the Roman Catholic church maintains was the first pope) was married, as were many of the other apostles (see 1 Corinthians 9:5).",

Remember, what makes the news is generally an isolated case, but it has been generalized to sound like common practice. At the same time, there are many different educational systems and criteria that it is hard to make comparisons. For example, as a general rule, most US universities will not consider a candidate for a Master's program if the Bachelor's was completed in less than 4 years. Countries that follow the British educational style will have spent a period of \"pre-university\" that can take up to 2 years before taking the final exams for the chosen papers. Then, completion of a Bachelor's degree takes only 3 years. To compare with the American system, we have the general education subjects before specialization tends to occur. In effect, bith systems are doing the same thing, it's a hang up about the time factor or classification of an area with which most are not familiar.. . Another idea to help keep in mind, for professional types of degrees and qualifications, each country has specific ideas as to what should be in the curriculum. For example, medical schools also empasize patient care and communication as part and parcel. Other countries medical degrees take less time as they empasize more on pathology and diagnosis. . . One more thing to remember, in the US we don't have a national standard. The US universities are independent and may not even accept credits from another US university. Many universities DO offer bridging programs where should you not meet the tradtitional requirements for a master's degree, you can apply your experience as well as take a few subjects you lack to re-evaluate your situation. Thos means you won't have to repeat everything - just fill in the gaps in your education that do not meet the standards of a particular university.",

I see wisdom as the smaller set of psychological or philosophical truths that one has gained, usually through experience. Wisdom is the knowledge of uncommon truth(s) that directly influences one's thoughts, feelings, and actions.. . I guess I believe this because of how frequently the word \"wise\" is associated with an old person who acts and thinks differently than other people because he has a greater understanding of the nature of things around him. The stereotypical example would be someone like Gandalf or Dumbledore.",

Absolute zero has very specific thermodynamic properties - it is the temperature where atoms have the minimum molecular vibration, which defines heat.  It's too complicated to describe here - suggest you check the reference.. . Anyway, looking at temperatures from absolute zero, all temperatures are positive.  Also, every element (and compound) has its own thermodynamic characteristics, including melting point, boiling point, and freezing point.  So Fluorine has a boiling point that is 85.15 degrees above absolute zero, water has a boiling point that is 373.15 degrees above absolute zero, and iron (for example) has a boiling point that is 3134 degrees above absolute zero.. .

In thermodynamics, there are four laws of very general validity, and as such they do not depend on the details of the interactions or the systems being studied.

Examples of this include Einstein's prediction of spontaneous emission around the turn of the 20th century and current research into the thermodynamics of black holes.. . The four laws are:. . Zeroth law of thermodynamics, stating that thermodynamic equilibrium is an equivalence relation. . If two thermodynamic systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. . . First law of thermodynamics, about the conservation of energy . The increase in the energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by heating, minus the amount lost in the form of work done by the system on its surroundings. . . Second law of thermodynamics, about entropy . The total entropy of any isolated thermodynamic system tends to increase over time, approaching a maximum value. . . Third law of thermodynamics, about absolute zero temperature . As a system asymptotically approaches absolute zero of temperature all processes virtually cease and the entropy of the system asymptotically approaches a minimum value. . . This law is more clearly stated as: \"the entropy of a perfectly crystalline body at absolute zero temperature is zero.\"",

Each planetary day begins at sunrise, and ends at the next day's sunrise. For example, Sunrise on Saturday is the beginning of the day of Saturn. Before sunrise on Saturday, you are still under the day of Venus.. . The day is divided into two parts; the day (time between sunrise and sunset) and the night (time between sunset and tomorrow's sunrise). Each part of the day is then divided into 12 equal parts, for a total of 24 (unequal) hours.. . The first planetary hour of the day is always the same as the planetary day; so sunrise on Monday is the beginning of both the day of the Moon and the hour of the Moon. The hours repeat infinitely in this order:. . *Saturn. *Jupiter. *Mars. *Sun. *Venus. *Mercury. *Moon. . . So the second planetary hour of the day of the Moon is the hour of Saturn, the third would be the hour of Jupiter, and so on.",

Finally, from NASA's \"Ask an Astrophysicist\" archive,. \"Yes, the Sun does rotate. We can observed this by observing sunspots. All sunspots move across the face of the Sun. This motion is part of the general rotation of the Sun on its axis. Observations also indicate that the Sun does not rotate as a solid body, but it spins differentially. That means that it rotates faster at the equator of the Sun and slower at its poles. (The gas giants Jupiter and Saturn also have differential rotation.) The movements of the sunspots indicate that the Sun rotates once every 27 days at the equator, but only once in 31 days at the poles.\" http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970108a.html",

Seed processed for sale must be tested by a qualified laboratory under the Association of Official Seed Analysts Rules for testing seeds. Several different kinds of testing are available depending on the type of seed to be tested, the conditions of the test, and the potential uses of the seed. The most common tests are the warm germination test, cold germination test, accelerated aging test, and the tetrazolium test. Each test is designed to evaluate various qualities of the seed. Factors that can affect the performance of seed in germination tests include; diseased seed, old seed, mechanically damaged seed, seed stored under high moisture, and excessive heating of seed during storage or drying. In most cases a seed treatment will improve germination of seed only if the poor quality is due to seed-borne disease. . . The most common test is a warm germination test because it is required by seed laws to appear on the label. The percentage of germinating seed in a warm germination test must be printed on the label of the seed if it is to be sold as seed. Germination is defined as: \"the emergence and development from the seed embryo of those essential structures which are indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions.\" The warm germination test reflects the stand producing potential of a seed lot under ideal planting conditions. Usually 400 seed from each seed lot are placed under moist conditions on blotters, rolled towels, or sand and maintained at 77 degrees F for about seven days. At the end of this period the seedlings are categorized as normal, abnormal, or diseased, and dead or hard seeds. The percentage germination is calculated from the number of normal seedlings from the total number of seeds evaluated. . . The cold germination test is designed to measure the ability of seeds to germinate under high soil-moisture content and low soil temperature. This vigor test simulates early season adverse field conditions and usually represents the lowest germination that would be expected from a seed lot planted under such conditions. Actual field germination would normally fall between the cold test result and that of the warm germination test. Seeds are planted in a sand-soil mix at high moisture content and maintained at 50 degrees F for seven days. The test is then placed at 77 degrees F for four days. The percentage of healthy seedlings that emerge at least one inch above the soil is reported. . . The accelerated aging test estimates the carryover potential of a seed lot in warehouse storage. The seeds are exposed to high temperatures and high relative humidity for short periods of time that cause seed deterioration. Seed are suspended over water in a chamber for 72 hours (wheat and soybeans) or 96 hours (corn) then tested in a standard warm germination test. This test only would be used on seed whose longevity was in question. . . The tetrazolium test is a \"quick test\" for seed lot viability. It is useful when an approximate germination percentage is needed immediately. Seeds are soaked overnight in water then treated with tetrazolium to give an indication of viable, abnormal, and dead seeds in the seed lot. This test will not detect seed-borne disease, thus is limited in its ability to estimate seed quality. This test is highly reliable for determining viable seed of corn, wheat, oats, barley, and other grasses. . . If growers wish to use bin-run seed and has not had a germination test conducted by a competent laboratory, they can get an approximate germination test using the following procedure in their own home. . . Place two paper towels in the bottom of a dish or tray, one on top of the other; wet the towels thoroughly and tilt the tray up on one end so that excess water runs off the tray.

A pre-leaf structure called the EPICOTYL also grows from embryo, but it grows UPWARDS towards the warmth and the light of the sun.  It might have to push thru some soil before it breaks ground, though.",

They are also able to detect gravity and they use that detection method to direct the roots in the proper direction.. . We did an experiment in college where we put seeds on a rotating disk to throw of their gravity detection.  The seeds roots were not able to orientate themselves.. . Keep in mind that nothing in science is 100%, we only have theories.  Since nobody can ask a plant how or why they do something we can only go by our results from experiments. Thus far our experiments show that seeds are able to detect gravity and sunlight to ensure proper orientation.",

Seeds regularly desiccated during their development on the mother plant and reached mass maturity at c. 42 d after flowering (DAF). Freshly harvested seeds did not germinate at any stage of development because they were dormant, but their dormancy was broken after 5\u20136 months of dry storage. Immature seeds were desiccation-tolerant at 24 DAF since they were able to germinate fully after artificial drying on the flowerheads followed by dry storage. CAT activity increased in non-dehydrated seeds during their development, reaching a maximum a little after seed mass maturity and after artificial drying in immature seeds. This stimulation of CAT activity by natural and artificial drying was related to changes in CAT isoform pattern. Of the four constitutive CAT subunits, that of 59 kDa was always present, but dehydration induced the synthesis of a 55 kDa subunit. This synthesis of the CAT 55 kDa subunit resulted from an activation of the CATA1 gene, suggesting that the regulation of catalase activity and synthesis by drying occurred at the transcriptional level. The increase in CAT activity induced by seed drying was associated with a decrease in hydrogen peroxide level and in lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that CAT plays a role during seed desiccation by preventing dehydration-related oxidative damage and that H2O2 may play a role in the regulation of CAT gene expression and the transduction pathway of the dehydration signal.",

Blue smoke is caused by oil consumption. The smell of coolant inside your car is caused by a leaking heater core.\"",

The Witch House  In February, 1692, three accused women were examined by Magistrates Jonathan Corwin and John Hathorne. Corwin's home, known as the Witch House, still stands at the corner of North and Essex Streets in Salem, providing guided tours and tales of the first witchcraft trials. John Hathorne, an ancestor of author Nathaniel Hawthorne, is buried in the Charter Street Old Burying Point.   .    By the time the hysteria had spent itself, 24 people had died. Nineteen were hanged on Gallows Hill in Salem Town, but some died in prison. Giles Corey at first pleaded not guilty to charges of witchcraft, but subsequently refused to stand trial. This refusal meant he could not be convicted legally. However, his examiners chose to subject him to interrogation by the placing of stone weights on his body. He survived this brutal torture for two days before dying. . It is remarkable 552 original documents pertaining to the witchcraft trials have been preserved and are still stored by the Peabody Essex Museum. . .

From June through September of 1692, nineteen men and women, all having been convicted of witchcraft, were carted to Gallows Hill, a barren slope near Salem Village, for hanging. Another man of over eighty years was pressed to death under heavy stones for refusing to submit to a trial on witchcraft charges. Hundreds of others faced accusations of witchcraft. Dozens languished in jail for months without trials.  Then, almost as soon as it had begun, the hysteria that swept through Puritan Massachusetts ended. .     Why did this travesty of justice occur? Why did it occur in Salem? Nothing about this tragedy was inevitable. Only an unfortunate combination of an ongoing frontier war, economic conditions, congregational strife, teenage boredom, and personal jealousies can account for the spiraling accusations, trials, and executions that occurred in the spring and summer of 1692. . .

Any legal actions the parents might pursue would be a civil suit.. . Also, in most cases, the court will appoint a lawyer to represent the child's interests, seperate from the parents, even if the parent(s) are not the offender.  (Again, how well they preform their jobs can be an issue...). . So, it's not a matter of it being legal or not, and who will pursue it, but it's more a matter of whether or not the legal system will adequately punish the offender, but all too often, they get away with just a slap on the wrist, because, after all, children don't vote or pay taxes, so they aren't as important to elected officials as they should be.",

Is 5% to high a number?  Yes, it is.  But one person that molests a child by ANY member of society is one to many.. . I do not condone what some of these priests have done, but I have to agree with what a previous poster has said.  The RCC is considered to be very wealthy, and some of these people who are claiming to be molested 30 and 40 years ago are after the money.. . Some are legit, I have no doubt, but for those that wait for so long, what is the reason?  In some cases the priest has died or retired, has moved around so much that it is impossible to decide what is truth.  Result?  Easy money AND it has the added benefit of making the Church look bad.. . Again, I do not condone what this small number of priests are doing, but I can not agree with your statement that the church actively recruits these people.. . Also, for those who say it is because they can not marry, I would like to bring to your attention that the vast majority of child molestors are married with children of their own.",

It only seem like there are more women who are shorter than men because you commonly see them walking around in pairs, and as you know very well, our society dictates that it's ideal to have a taller guy in a relationship than a taller girl. . But Try to check out tha physical stature of guys and girls from an asian country for a change. And compare the height of the asian males to those of caucasian females.You'll see that there are more taller caucasian females than asian males! Proving that it is not really true that guys are actually taller than women.It depends on a lot of factors really, ANd sometimes you just gotta look at it from a different perspective in order to see what is not obvious.",

If you're allergic to aspirin then skip it and wait 14 days before unwrapping the tape.. . Another remedy that wors better and doesn't make you look silly for a week.. is find a man who is the 7th son (meaning he has 6 older brothers) and have him 'rub away' the wart. All he has to do is rub his thumb over the wart for a few seconds.. when you forget about it, it'll be gone.. .   My two oldest boys had gotten warts all over their hands and I had a 7th son rub them off.

The oldest didn't believe they'd be gone and they weren't but the youngest did believe. It really works.

Using axle grease or coal oil for cuts probably made pretty good sense, especially if you got well.. . In 1996, we completed \"Rub Onions and Skunk Oil on my Chest and Call Me Well,\" a collection of home remedies and folk medicines. Most of the contributions came from older people who used the folk remedies themselves or remembered parents or grandparents who found the home medicines an essential part of rural life in Texas. We discovered a multitude of cures for warts, but they often fell more into the realm of superstition than remedies.. . Several people told us to rub our warts with a rooster comb, and bury it.. . Ruby Yount of Lufkin said her mother-in-law removed several warts from her kids' hands, and it was all done in privacy. She tied a knot of sewing thread over the wart, then went outside and buried it in the earth. By the time the thread rotted, the wart was gone",

Couscous was traditionally made from the hard part of the hard wheat Triticum durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the relatively primitive millstone. The name is also used for prepared dishes made from other grains, such as barley, millet, sorghum, rice, or maize. Couscous is traditionally served under a meat or vegetable stew.. . In the United States couscous is known as a type of pasta, probably reflecting the influence of Sicilian immigrants. However in most other countries it is treated more like a grain in its own right.

If you are skinnier to begin with, you lose fat on your torso--stomach, waist--since the other fat is already gone. The key to getting a six pack, thus, is to do lots of cardio (given you already have plenty of muscle.) Stripping the fat away, you will reveal your abs.

He continually asks his guests\u2019 one simple question: \"How's it working for you?\". . Success in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.. . I am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don't want you to know about.. . Before I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. . . So how does your body burn fat?. . It is a two steps process and in order to lose body fat you need to:. . 1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then. 2.You can burn the fat. . How does your body release the fat from the cells?. . Before you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 3.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 4.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. 5.Drink plenty of water. . . How does your body burn the fat? . . If you started exercising and then reached a plateau, you have probably burned more muscle tissue than fat with your workout. This is the worst thing that could happen.. . Let me explain. . . Less Muscle = slower metabolism = Weight loss plateau. Then you end up in the yo-yo dieting bandwagon.. . How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . Your muscle tissue is your best friend when it comes to burn body fat. You need to preserve muscle tissues in order to keep losing weight. Most people go on a starvation diet combined a lot of cardio to lose weight. At first it may seems like this is working because they are losing scale weight. . . Now think about, scale weight does not tell you if weight loss is from fat, water or muscle tissue. Scale weight by itself is not a good indicator of success.. . To maintain muscle tissues you need to:. 1.Do some resistance training. (This is not optional, it is mandatory). . . The secret. . Now that you understand the whole fat burning process, I am going to reveal to you how celebrity personal trainers do to get those amazing transformations. The strategy is to combine all the steps that I outlined so the body works as a unit.  First, the trainer makes sure that his client is eating the proper food on a regular basis. . . By that, I mean eating so that fat WILL be released from the fat cells. Then and only then they exercise the body to burn the fat. The important idea to take from this is:. . \"The fat can ONLY be burned after it is released from the fat cells\".. . If you know anybody that has been exercising like a maniac and they don't seem to go anywhere, now you know why.. . The reverse is also true, do you know somebody that is eating properly but they are not including any resistance training combined with moderate cardio. Now you know why their body still looks the same.. . All you need to do is to combine a nutrition program, along with some MODERATE cardio program and maintain muscle mass with resistance training. Everything is combined with one goal in mind: Turning your body into an Automatic fat burning machine. It is that easy.. . There is a fina",

Crunches, leg lifts, sit ups etc will not get rid of the fat but will tone and strengthen the underlying muscles while you burn the fat off with cardio.. . Forget that digestion claim about the belly fat.. . Exercise and proper diet incorporated into your lifestyle will get rid of that belly fat and keep it off!!!",

He wanted a place where both children and adults could learn and have fun together.  Disney believed in being a child at heart.  Children search, discover, and are not embarrased to admit they have learned.  Disneyland was created as place of education, hope, and love to all people.  Embracing the child within is healthy and is something that should be explored by every individual, everyday.  I'm not naive enough to think that elements in Walt Disney's original plan for Disneyland have not been changed for business purposes, and there is the slowly spreading belief that Disney is for children, when Walt Disney firmly believed that any business geared directly toward children would not be successful.  So, no Disneyland is for everyone.  It's for discovering that sometimes fantasy is more real than reality.  . . One time a man was at Disneyland and sat on a bench next to another, older man who, at the time, was difficult to recognize.  The younger man mentioned how Disneyland kept you from reality, and the older man promptely answered that this park was reality, and it was everything outside of it, that was fantasy.  That older man was Walt Disney.. . So go enjoy Disneyland.  Learn the beautiful history behind It's a Small World, so you may enjoy it.  Understand it's appearance at the World's Fair.  Know what a step that World's Fair was in technology and the understanding of other cultures.  Learn and explore.  It's a small world after all, with a lot to learn in it.  And sing...  sing it's a small world.",

And a consumer turns customer, when he/she chooses a particular product or service, and buys it ! . ...But the sad part is that even persons who are actively involved in marketing and advertising confuse themselves [and others too !] by misusing both of these terms !",

From the article, here are some tips:. . 1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. . . 2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords \u00ad your potential clients \u00ad and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. For effective techniques on cold calling, read \"Tips to Successful Cold Calling\"  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/blog/2006/05/tips-to-successful-cold-calling.html. . 3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.). . 4. Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.. . 5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.. . 6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. . . 7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.. . For detailed information I suggest you read the following books:. . - Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services . - The Janitorial Contractors Bible . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business . - Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business",

In modern houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as Majordomo, Butler Administrator, Staff Manager, Estate Manager and Head of Household Staff are sometimes given.. . The word \"butler\" derives from the Old French \"bouteillier\", (meaning \"cup bearer\"), from \"bouteille\", (\"bottle\"). The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages (which in ancient times represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.). . In Britain the butler was originally a middle ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries the butler gradually became the usually senior male member of a household's staff (in the very grandest households there was sometimes a house steward senior to the butler into the 19th century). Butlers used to always be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the livery of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a business suit or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.. . The earliest literary mention of a butler is probably that of the man whose release from prison was predicted by Joseph in the biblical account of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams of the Pharaoh's servants.. . In London there remains only one hotel which offers a private butler service, The Lanesborough Hotel.",

However, being a relatively new area, the definition of emotional intelligence is still in a state of flux. Some, such as John D. Mayer (2005a) prefer to distinguish emotional knowledge from emotional intelligence, as discussed below.. . In 1920, E. L. Thorndike, at Columbia University, (Thorndike 1920), used the term \"social intelligence\" to describe the skill of getting along with other people. In 1975, Howard Gardner's The Shattered Mind, (Gardner 1975) began the formulation of the idea for \"Multiple Intelligences\" (he identifies eight intelligences), including both interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence. Many psychologists, such as Gardner, believe that traditional measures of intelligence, such as the IQ test, fail to fully explain cognitive ability. (Smith 2002). . The term \"emotional intelligence\" appears to have originated with Wayne Payne (1985), but was popularized by Daniel Goleman (1995). The leading research on the concept originated with Peter Salovey and John \"Jack\" Mayer starting in the late 1980s. In 1990, their seminal paper (1990) defined the concept as an intelligence. Mayer and Salovey continued to research the concept, and created an emotional intelligence test called the MSCEIT (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test). The term \"emotional quotient\" seems to have originated in an article by Keith Beasley (1987). Bar-on (1997) developed a test measuring emotional quotient, called the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQi). There are numerous other assessments of emotional intelligence each advocating different models and measures.. . I copied it from the site.",

I am a church leader myself, and in my tradition we always worship on Sunday, and we always worship on Christmas.  So, my church will be open.  That doesn't make us any better than anyone else, its just that we see Christmas as a holiday of the church rather than a family holiday (like Mother's Day or something).",

I bet Alot of people who are \"church-a-holics\" (as I call them) probably can't even tell what the sermon was about the second they walk out the church doors. What is the point in going 3 times a week if you are \"bored\" b/c I know you aren't listening when your there. I think churches should as a group on Sunday nights go to an organization where people are in need and help them INSTEAD of having another service and TAKING UP ANOTHER OFFERING.  . AND HERES ANOTHER THOUGHT......... You said your bored....ok....again why go then?  Do you think you are fooling GOD?  While you may be able to fool other people by going to church 3 times a week- you can't fool GOD.  He knows you dont want to be there.  . .

Easter:  Easter is a more generic term that can apply to the entire season of the church year that lasts fifty days.  The term, \"Easter Sunday\" would therefore be the precise method of designating which day of the fifty day period we are talking about, much as \"Christmas Day\" designates December 25 from the more generic Christmas season. (Beginning to look a lot like \"Christmas\", \"Christmas\" time, getting ready for \"Christmas\", etc.). . As for 12 noon and 12 midnight, this is probably more a function of the need for colloquial redundancy in our spoken language (yes, I realize that was redundant) and also the fact that we are often designating morning or evening for the times we give -- 3 in the afternoon, 3 in the morning, so we act out of habit.  Much of our language is redundant so that we can effectively communicate.  Just think how small the information of this paragraph actually is when reduced electronically because of its redundancy.  It doesn't mean that I should type this out in ones and zeros however.  Information theory has exposed just how redundant our language is and how important reduncancy is for accuracy and clarity.. . As for the hot water heater, you probably never took a science class or you would realize that thermodynamics requires the hot water to be heated or it will get cold.. . Oh and one more thing, I'm a proponent of redundancy since it enhances clarity, but isn't it redundant to write the following:  \"Either midnight or noon will suffice, I'm well aware that it's 12 either way.\"  You could have said: \"Either midnight or noon will suffice.\" or \"I'm well aware that it's 12 either way.\"  Aren't those pretty much the same thing?. .

Commercial airlines do not have the money or time to stock planes with so many parachutes and train all passengers ahead of time in their proper usage, even if the conditions were ideal for using them. In an emergency, the conditions would not be ideal.. . Also, the military is properly trained, and like mentioned before as well, the planes are equipped with ejector seats, since it cost enough time and money to train those pilots in to perform their specialised tasks that they would not want to risk losing his life. Equipment can be rebuilt, however costly, but people cannot be as efficiently trained to make up for the loss. Sadly, according to the \"good of the nation,\" the life of a specialist in the military is monetarily worth a lot more than the average civilian.. . Also, consider the security risk. Besides the accidental \"user errors\" of the passengers in the event of somebody opening the door mid-flight or simply not knowing how to open the 'chute, there's a possibility of terrorism that I don't believe has been mentioned yet.. . During ascension, when the plane is not yet too high up in the air, and there is smaller risk of being sucked into the engine, a terrorist could easily plant a bomb on the plane or kill a pilot and then bail out.

If an airplane breaks apart at high altitude (tremendously rare) then I think everybody would pass-out due to lack of oxygen before they had a chance to put on a parachute. . . The only situation that I could think of in which a parachute would be useful would be if a flight had engine or landing gear problems, and a low-altitude bail-out would be possible (Look-out cows!)

And Adam, that simpleton, ate the apple. This too worked well for millenaries, effectively putting women in subservient position.

            "passage": "Boy, are you mixed up! I read your other questions, so I don't know if you think well enough or know English well enough to understand this, but here goes! God's nature is love. For love to be love there has to be something or someone to love. The reason that God created both angels and humans is so that He would have someone to love and to love Him in return. Also, if humans love each other as well as love God, the love is multiplied. That is why when Jesus was asked, What is the greatest commandment? He answered, \"To love the LORD your God with all your heart and all your mind and all your strentgh. And the 2nd is like unto it, to love your neighbor as yourself.\".    Now, here is where problems came in. The nature of love is that it can't be commanded. If God created us so that we had to love Him - that we had no choice - then, that wouldn't be love. Love has to be a choice. That is one of the reasons why God gave us free choice, so that we could choose to love Him..    God did not create Satan. Satan's original name was Lucifer,. which means, the light bringer (or bearer). Lucifer was the smartest and the most powerful angel that God created. But Lucifer and the other angels were also given freewill so that they could choose to love God. Lucifer, became full of pride at being the smartest and the most powerful angel and chose to not love God and to not obey God. He wanted to be God himself! Satan convinced 1/3rd of the angels to follow him instead of God and for this they were kicked out of Heaven. This is also why that after Jesus's 2nd coming Satan and the angels that followed him will be cast into hell and never let out. .   Now, as you can immagine, Satan is very angry about this. He knows that he is going to hell and also that God doesn't  want any human to go to hell. Satan wants to cause as many humans to go to hell as possible. His main weapon is lies. At the time that Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden they had only one commandment they had to obey. Only one, can you immagine it.. God told them to \"not eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\", and if they did, that they would die. Satan lied to Eve and said that God lied to her. That if she ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge she would be like God and be able to tell good from evil and that she wouldn't die. Satan said God lied about her dying if she ate that fruit (it wasn't an apple!) because God didn't love her and Adam and have their best interest at heart. Too bad that Adam believed Eve instead of God and here we are. Adam and Eve got kicked out of the Garden of Eden, they did die, and all of us will die too, at least our bodies will..    Satan is still telling the same lies today. He says that God doesn't love us and that the rules he gave us in the Bible are not in our best interest. An earlier person who answered your question said that freewill meant that we could do what we want and accept the consequences. Well, God said the consequenses of sin are pain in this life, death, and everlasting suffering in hell. Since those are the consequenses of sin, I will choose to the best of my ability, not to do what I want if it is a sin but what God wants and tells us in the Bible. I think to choose anything else is stupid! Remember, Satan is a lier and God really does love us. I hope this may help anyone who takes the time to read this, God bless you.",

For example, even if Jesus came back, there would still be some who wouldn't believe he was who he claimed to be!  . . After all, he was crucified his first visit!. . You think that may be why he hasn't come back? :-). . Moreover, there is disagreement even among Christian sects (Catholics, Baptists, Presbyterians, and so on), about how your life should be lived.  So even among his followers, there is, and most likely always will be, disagreements.. . And we haven't even mentioned the Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and others.. . Moreover, I imagine that God wants it that way!  I believe he practices \"free speech\", and he doesn't bar anyone's beliefs in how to live - until, and this is the key here, until (1) they claim theirs is the only true religion, and (2)they  harm others.. . So to achieve the goals of your question, we must work to allow anyone to worship any god they choose, and respect that decision, unless the two rules above are violated.. . I believe that's what god wants! . . But you pose a good question, and I hope you find a way to help achieve the premise!",

Oaky, yeah, we had to be tough before then, too...the \"out of the trees\" is just an imperfect analogy.  Anyway, it's built in.  Younger hunters/warriors had to push the older guys out of the way whenever the older guys began to slow down in their reaction times and running ability because the slower they were, the hungrier the tribe would be.  Ever try to run down an antelope?  Then you get my drift, don't ya?  Also, the older guy is less likely a good candidate for a mate - girls needed to save themselves for really healthy mates who were more likely to produce healthy offspring.

            "passage": "\"Cellulite\" Removers. Stephen Barrett, M.D.. Cellulite is a term coined in European salons and spas to describe deposits of dimpled fat found on the thighs and buttocks of many women. Widespread promotion of the concept in the United States followed the 1973 publication of Cellulite: Those Lumps, Bumps and Bulges You Couldn't Lose Before, by Nicole Ronsard, owner of a New York City beauty salon that specialized in skin and body care. Cellulite is alleged to be a special type of \"fat gone wrong,\" a combination of fat, water, and \"toxic wastes\" that the body has failed to eliminate. Alleged \"anticellulite\" products sold through retail outlets, by mail, through multilevel companies, and through the Internet have included \"loofah\" sponges; cactus fibers; special washcloths; horsehair mitts; creams [A, B, C] and gels to \"dissolve\" cellulite; supplements containing vitamins; minerals and/or herbs [A, B, C]; bath liquids; massagers [A, B]; rubberized pants; exercise books; brushes; rollers; body wraps; and toning lotions. Many salons offer treatment with electrical muscle stimulation, vibrating machines, inflatable hip-high pressurized boots, \"hormone\" or \"enzyme\" injections, heating pads, and massage. Some operators claim that 5 to 15 inches can be lost in one hour. A series of treatments can cost hundreds of dollars.. . \"Cellulite\" is not a medical term. Medical authorities agree that cellulite is simply ordinary fatty tissue [1]. Strands of fibrous tissue connect the skin to deeper tissue layers and also separate compartments that contain fat cells. When fat cells increase in size, these compartments bulge and produce a waffled appearance of the skin. Many years ago, Neil Solomon, M.D., conducted a double-blind study of 100 people to see whether cellulite differed from ordinary fat. Specimens of regular fat and lumpy fat were obtained by a needle biopsy procedure and given to pathologists for analysis and comparison. No difference between the two was found.. . More recently, researchers at Rockefeller Institute used ultrasonography, microscopic examinations, and fat-metabolism studies to see \"affected\" and unaffected skin areas differed in seven healthy adult subjects (five women, two men; four affected, three unaffected). The researchers concluded: (a) certain characteristics of skin make women more prone than men to develop cellulite; (b) the process is diffuse rather than localized; and (3) there were no significant differences in the appearance or function of the fatty tissue or the regional blood flow between affected and unaffected sites within individuals [2].. . Electrical Muscle Stimulators (EMS) and Iontophoresis Devices. Muscle stimulators are a legitimate medical device approved for certain conditions -- to relax muscle spasms, increase blood circulation, prevent blood clots, and rehabilitate muscle function after a stroke. But many health spas and figure salons claim that muscle stimulators can remove wrinkles, perform face lifts, reduce breast size, reduce a \"beer belly,\" and remove cellulite. Iontophoresis devices are prescription devices that use direct electric current to introduce ions of soluble salts (i.e., medications) into body tissues for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. The only approved use is for diagnosing cystic fibrosis.. . The FDA considers promotion of muscle stimulators or iontophoresis devices for any type of body shaping or contouring to be fraudulent [3,4]. The most infamous of these devices, the Relax-A-Cizor, was claimed to reduce girth by delivering electric shocks to the muscles. More than 400,000 units were sold for $200 to $400 each before the FDA obtained an injunction in 1970 to stop its sale. At the trial, 40 witnesses testified that they had been injured while using the machine. The judge concluded that the device could cause miscarriages and aggravate many preexisting me",

Gastric juices can literally dissolve a nail.  That is if the gastric  juices are in a container and a nail put in the container within a month the nail is dissolved, this is an experiment we did when I was in graduate school.

If the seats are cloth and/or the vomit ended up on the floor, then you will definitely need a heavy duty cleaner and disinfectant.  Lysol will certainly do the trick.  The key is to use as little water as possible, so that you aren't simply spreading it around.  Let it dry completely between cleanings... you should repeat 3 times.  The smell will probably still be there, so it will be a good idea to use carpet fresh just as you would the floors in your home.  Then top it all off with your favorite scent of car air freshener.... I recommend a Car Jar in the Macintosh scent.  you should probably leave your windows cracked during this process so all those smells have a chance to dissipate.. .

            "passage": "Public speaking is an art that requires practice. Ah's, eh's, and um's are all common filler words that Americans use when they are unsure of their next set of words. For a prepared speech I would simply practice the speech several times before actually delivering it. However, if you are part of a situation that involves impromptu (no notes; press conference. e.g.) or extemporaneous speaking( limited preparation and some notes; class report . e.g.) breaking the \"ah\" habit will be much more difficult. First, instead of using a filler word, just pause for a moment. If you are at the end of a sentence this will appear very natural and I guarantee the pause will seem much longer to you than it will to the audience. The pause will benefit the audience allowing them to absorb what you have said, and also benefit you, eliminating the ah and providing time to reorganize thoughts.. . If you listen to Jazz musicians speak about improvisation they will always mention the importance of silence in improvisation to providing actually musical quality. Imagine if The drums and horns never stopped playing. It would be a cacophony no one would enjoy. The same holds true for public addresses. A speaker that never stops is a speaker no one is going to truly listen to or at the very least enjoy.. . Of course, you should practice avoiding filler words in all of your conversations. Habits we develop in everyday speech will also pop their heads up in public addresses. Therefor, even if you are just talking to a friend about some trivial matter, try to avoid filler words.  Don't be afraid to ask you friends to point out when you use any. . . As a final piece of advice, if nothing else seems to work to get rid of the ah's, I would suggest \"practice sessions.\" Practice delivering a speech in front of an audience (humans, not cats or babies) and have the audience throw things at you or squirt you when you use a filler word. Physical teaching is even effective in speech. . . Best of luck.",

At least Bush will be out of office soon, of course, that doesn't mean anything will improve.",

For example: just as you see rioting in islamic countries, you do NOT see them in the US concerning oil companies who are purposly keeping prices high.   . . Second Answer. There are some societies which do not really mind cars or infrastructure. It does not mean that they cannot achieve the western standards, they simply prefer it that way.. The fact is that modern infrastructure (cars+roads+tv+internet+electricity) worked its way through after industrial revolution (after a century and a half). Imagine Europe or US before that.. .

As you may know Henry Kissinger, US Secretary of State under Presidents Nixon & Ford says \"Oil is much too important a commodity to be left in the hands of the Arabs.---\" . Fact is Oil cant be produced in an unstable country because it is flamable itself and need lots of pipeline to transfer so there must be stable countries in unstable atmosphere.. Middle east has been unstable for many years, USSR and UK has been in territory before WWI and has been replaced by US after that. Israel and Arabs have problems since WWII, Iranians and Arabs have problems even before Islam.... About being poor, apart from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahran, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, Turkey, Lebonan... there are some poor Islamic countries like Yaman, Afghanestan..... I don't think Islam has been the reason that they are poor, they are mostly countries without resources and good leaders, some of them have been in war since many years ago like Afghanestan.. You can't generalize it, there are many rich Islamic countries and there are poor Islamic countries, you can't say every christian country is rich or every Islamic country is poor.. Proper question is why Islamic countries are not advanced in technology. You can't compare Islamic countries with China, as you know most of resources are in Small countries and they rather buy western cars every year instead of making a automobile factory, you must take it easy on them, you can't force Emarat Arabs to do so, you better know how they are, they even don't explore their oil, western companies do that for them, they don't have an army, western troops protect them, what do you expect of these people? to spend money on science? Do you think its Islam fault?. This is not a problem with Islam, this is a problem with  Muslims, you know that most of Islamic scientist weren't from Saudi Arabia.. You know that science has been emphasized in Islam, there is a Hadith from Mohammad that says \"Learn Sience from cradle to grave\". Like always you have neglected Iran, I have told you, you don't know anything about Iran, there is an Iranian passenger car(Maybe not comparable with BMW but It's not that bad, it can satisfy euro3 standards http://www.ikco.com) and TVs, there are some Iranian TV producers and there are good universities in Iran, they export lots of students each year and we explore our oil ourselves.",

When the burst hits an object, a small portion of the energy is reflected back to the antenna.

            "passage": "BLACK FRIDAY (SHOPPING) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_Sale. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. . Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving in the United States, is historically one of the busiest retail shopping days of the year. Many consider it the \"official\" beginning to the holiday season. Most retailers will open very early and usually provide massive discounts on their products.. . Although Black Friday is typically the busiest shopping day of the year in terms of customer traffic, it is not typically the day with the highest sales volume. That is usually either Christmas Eve or the last Saturday before Christmas.. . Origin. . The first use of this term to describe the day after Thanksgiving is not exactly known. There are two popular theories as to its origin.. . Accounting practice. . One theory is that stores traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season. When this would be recorded in the financial records, common accounting practices use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink would show positive amounts. Black Friday is the beginning of the period where they would no longer have losses (the red) and instead take in the year's profits (the black).. . Stress from large crowds. . Another theory comes from the fact that shopping experience on this day can be extremely stressful. The term is used as a comparison to the extremely stressful and chaotic experience of Black Thursday or other black days. According to The Word Spy:. . Earliest Citation:. Christmas decorations around Tampa Bay started going up in late October, and business has been brisk since then. And while Friday--known as Black Friday for the legendary hordes--will be the biggest shopping day for many area stores, others ring up the greatest sales the Saturday before Christmas.. \u2014Marilyn Marks, \"Retailers expect good sales this Christmas,\" St. Petersburg Times, November 27, 1986. . There exists an earlier reference, speaking to the Friday after Thanksgiving:. . A BLACK FRIDAY.. There have been many Black Fridays in recent history. Most of them have been days of financial panic. There has been none of blacker foreboding than last Friday. And the blackness is not loss or fear of loss in stocks and bonds.. New York Times (1857-Current file).. New York, N.Y.: Dec 3, 1922. pg. 38, 1 pgs. ISSN/ISBN 03624331. . Employees of retail stores have for years referred to Black Friday in a satirical way, to note the extremely stressful and hectic nature of the day. Heavy traffic and customer demands added to the long hours make it a difficult day.. . . Black Friday on the Internet. . Advertisements in advance. . Certain websites such as DealTaker.com offer information about Black Friday deals up to a month in advance. The text listings of prices are usually accompanied by adscans -- complete PDFs either leaked by insiders, or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.. . Cyber Monday. . The term Cyber Monday refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday, which unofficially marks the beginning of the holiday online shopping season.. . In recent years, Cyber Monday has become a busy day for online retailers, with some sites offering low prices and other promotions on that day.. . Controversy. . Response (Buy Nothing Day). . Anti-consumer frenzy protesters have chosen this day as Buy Nothing Day in North America, where those concerned about the increasing power and influence of consumer corporations are urged to not make consumer purchases.. . DMCA. . In recent years, some retailers (including Wal-Mart, Target Corporation, Best Buy, and Staples, Inc.) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisement are intellectual property and protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).. .

So racism is one way ppl try to secure their space and happiness by joining large  groups and safegurding each others interests. Other problems also arise due to the same cause, like terrorism and  and corruption but racism has hit the world for long and bad because there are large numbers of ppl (and their votes) involved,  and larger the group , the stronger they are. Forces of democracy, u could say. .    Not that only democracies have racism. Middle east where the rulers are biased and represent one community also face the brunt of racist/communal riots. But I haven't heard of racist fights in China which is a populous country with minimal democracy. I found the link below about the type of racism in China..

Agnosticism does not lie between atheism and theism, it is separate. Atheism and theism form a universal set (ie encompass all people, everyone is either an atheist or a theist). Theists believe there is a god, atheists are people who aren't theists, they lack that belief. There is nothing in between, you either believe there is a god, or you don't.. . Agnostics are people who have no knowledge of a god. I imagine this usually goes along with atheism, people have no knowledge of a god and thus lack belief in a god, and so they are agnostic atheists (or atheistic agnostics if you prefer it that way around). I have met some people who say they have no knowledge that a god exists, but believe anyway (because they want it to be true maybe, I don't know). These people are agnostic theists.. . Personally I'm an agnostic atheist. I have never experienced or perceived a god in any way and thus lack any knowledge of a god, and since I can't believe in something I have no knowledge of I lack belief in a god too.",

Personally speaking, honey, my Conscience holds me accountable for every mean word I say to others.  My Conscience holds me accountable for each bird I flip to other drivers.

Being agnostic OR atheist does not mean we run from our responsibilities.  Most of us DO live highly ethical lives as according to what we stand for (treating others compassionately, helping others when needed, taking responsibility when required).  We hold ourselves accountable. . . Personally speaking for myself, I am agnostic simply because Religion has yet to prove that 'god' exists AND science has yet to disprove 'god'.

That doesn't mean that terrorism is accepted at all, just when u r attacked and killed and your land is taken and occupied dont expect that those occuped people will go and protest for the occuper rights ? that doesn't make sence right ? . . 4. For me ( I am a muslim girl) i would like very much to go and protest against terrorism , but you dont undestand that protesting and making demonestration is something very hard in here, and would lead to many bad results, it's not easy at all to go and say \"No for terrorism\" the way the police and government deals with demonestrations in here still needs great developing to be really modern.. .

RNA translates this information into specific instructions for the assembly of proteins, transmits the information outside the cell nucleus and helps to assemble them. Each DNA molecule contains hundreds of millions of atoms in a specific and unique sequence. The DNA molecule is shaped like a ladder twisted into a spiral, like a telephone cord. The rungs of the ladder are molecules called nucleotides; the rail of the ladder consists of alternating molecules of sugar and phosphate. There are four nucleotides, each of which is half of a complementary base pair. Each nucleotide fits into its mate on the opposite rail like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. When a cell reproduces a segment of the DNA ladder unzips. The base pairs separate and expose the nucleotides. Each exposed nucleotide attracts its complement from chemicals present in the cell nucleus. The result is two new ladders, each of which is identical to the original. At other times short sections of DNA unzip to expose a certain sequence of base pairs, called a gene. This is where RNA comes in. RNA is similar to DNA in some ways. Nucleotides in RNA are held together by sugars and phosphates. RNA differs from DNA in that each RNA molecule is only a single strand of nucleotides, and is much shorter. An RNA molecule is created by matching the sequence of exposed nucleotides on the unzipped DNA molecule. The RNA is an inverse copy of the gene, like a negative film image. Encoded in it is the information which will be decoded and translated to make the proteins which form the basis of life. Our physical being is an assemblage of thousands of proteins of various types. Structural materials like skin, claws, nails, bones, hair, muscles and the hard bodies of insects and shellfish are proteins. Enzymes are proteins, as are chemicals like insulin and hemoglobin. Proteins are the chemicals of life. The proteins and nucleotide sequence is slightly different for each individual. The types of proteins and the length of DNA are different for each species. But we share with all other people and all other forms of life the same set of amino acids, the same nucleotides and the same genetic code.",

He has also hurt all Democrats running in the South and border states, many of them have tried to distance themselves with His very liberal views but this will hurt them BAD. The irony of the whole thing is He did fight in Vietnam, He did get purple heart, He has helped get benefits for all Veterans, He does support giving the troops the funds for the materials they need to fight and Bush has put us in a war with no plan of withdrawal, cut veterans benefits, and for months our troops did not have the armored vehicles or even the bulletproof vest for all of them.

Guiness is a light porter, if there are plenty of dark beers out there not just guiness. Porters, stouts, and other deep black beers are the most popular type. If you want a more detailed explanation of WHY it is black, take a trip to www.beeradvocate.com. . Here is an exert from a recent interview with Fergal Murray, a guiness brewaster. . \"A lot of Guinness lovers swear the beer\u2019s color has recently changed from black to ruby red. Murray insisted otherwise; rather, only certain types of glassware (like the company\u2019s own narrow-bottomed vessels), he said, truly showcase the beer\u2019s ruby hue.\". . Most Americans look at Stout as a thick, murky, \"eat it with a spoon\" beer. It is also a common misconception that these black beers are more potent, simply due to their appearance. Plenty of Bostonians see it as a nitro forced black beverage and happily quaff down several pints a night with out a second thought, usually a Guinness Draught or Murphy's. Guinness has less alcohol than Budweiser, around 4.2% alcohol by volume (on tap, 4.1% draught can, in the US) which would explain why everyone can drink so much of it, so quickly, and why it has become a popular session beer. But, here's a little Stout 101 for the novices, for those that might want to switch things up a bit: We have all been to one of the many Irish pubs in the area, and friends or co-workers talk in awe about Guinness and how it is the best stout, if not beer, in the world. Not entirely true. The modern day Guinness \"on draught version\" is definitely the best selling Stout in the world, but there's more to the story.. . There are many variations of the stout beer style. Some are dry and some are sweet, some hoppy and some alcoholic. All have that common characteristic of a roasted flavour that sets them apart from any other style. Usually this roasted character comes from the use of roasted barley, which is barley grain that has not been malted, but rather highly kilned. The process imparts a uniqueness to the grain and creates flavours ranging from bitter unsweetened chocolate to coffee, to a dry grain astringency.. . In the late 1600's to early 1700's, the term \"stout\" was often used to reference a strong beer. When the term actually became a style is up for interpretation, however, what we do know is that back in the late 1700's, when Guinness was first brewing what was then called its Porter, it was not brewing the light bodied easy to suck down creamy stout that most imbibers enjoy today. It was a dark murky looking brew, standing, roughly, a whopping 7.5% abv. Guinness first brewed a strong export style to be shipped to the Caribbean, an Export / Foreign Stout, hence the name Guinness Foreign Export Strong Porter (later to be called, Foreign Extra Stout). It had a very complex, huge body, big hop profile and an intense robust character. You can still purchase it today -- and it's very much brewed the same way -- but only in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.. . In the very late 1700's, some English breweries produced an export stout, similar to a foreign export, specifically for the Baltic area. This variation was called a Russian Imperial Stout. Brewed to an extreme strength, around 8-11% abv, and conditioned for months, even aged for years before consumption, these brews were quite popular within the Russian Imperial Court. The closest rendition of this brew is A. Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout imported by B. United International. Others include: North Coast's Old Rasputin Imperial Stout, Smuttynose Imperial Stout, Sam Smith Imperial Stout and Rogue Imperial Stout.. . One of the most common stouts, Dry Irish Stout, can be any where from 3.5-5.5% abv, with a moderate body to keep it on the drinkable side. They're usually a lower carbonation brew and serv",

The common themes amongst the three religions that you mentioned (radical or devout evangelists replacing \"Protestant Christians\") are as follows:. (1) They are all relatively young, though well established religions or sects; and. (2) They emphasize that their religion is the only way to salvation and they feel that it is their duty to both save souls and expand their religion.. . These religious groups are also much more zealous in their beliefs than most other sects of christianity, and are therefore more focused on their religion, and more driven to expand it.. . In the case of Mormons, every Mormon man is expected to go on a two-year \"mission\" around the age of 19.  That mission is to espouse the religious beliefs of the Mormon Church and to convert non-believers.  Mormon women also go on missions, though some start families before they are able to do so.. . As for Evangelists, they are very zealous in their beliefs and they tend to emphasize a \"close, personal relationship with Christ.\"  They therefore urge others, even those who share most of the same beliefs, to be \"reborn,\" hence the term born-again Christians.  Other sects of evangelical christians believe in the \"Rapture,\" when God will supposedly elevate all believers (read \"all good Evangelists) directly to heaven.  The Rapture is believed to occur at the end of the world, and is God's method of saving his beloved children before the coming Armageddon.. . Finally, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that there are only a finite number of spots in heaven.  It therefore seems almost counter-intuitive for them to try to convert others, as that would lessen their chances of entering heaven, but their religion heavily emphasizes conversion.  They are a very conservative religious group, abstaining from celebrations of birthdays and even religious holidays, and they probably think that such celebration and other forms of hedonism are an affront to their beliefs.  Thus, if they could convert more people, they could reduce the amount of hedonism and debauchery in the world.",

You gotta consider as well what it would be like to get pregnant and then have a man leave you once you have a child.  Now you need major bucks for diapers and formula AND you gotta work too.  . On the flipside, you could ask why most guys like hot women (I'm a guy and I only date hot women), cause once you've been with some, you don't feel attracted to a woman whose sorta cute or just average.  Lots of women complain about this, but lots of us guys gotta have a hottie, so us men slave at the office, and more and more women better hit the gym to compete with their fitter and healthier counterparts.. To me it's about degree.  If she's really materialistic then forget it, but if she's only a little or somewhat materialistic, then that's tolerable, and that's just life. . You'll often notice a correlation as well between a woman's self-image and degree of materialism.  Generally the more materialistic she is, the lower her is self-image is once you REALLY get to know her.  . Consider her upbringing as well. What kind of life did she have growing up.  Was she a super princess who always got everything?  This is a complex issue, but the bottom line is don't let it get you down... there are lots of ways to a good lady's heart.

If you notice, most history textbooks give a half-assed report of the 1990's through today. That's because too many people will rise up against the book if the authors try to put any personal information in it. For example, when a book says James Buchanan or Martin Van Buren was a bad president, there will be no objections, because they are dead and their parties defunct. If a book says George Bush Sr. was a bad president, there are still people alive to argue against that. Too much stress, so covering recent history broadly is easier for the book publishers.",

What do you make an hour?  Now divide it all out.  Believe me, bartenders and food servers are not in line to take over for Donald Trump.  Most have a hard time making ends meet.. . I think the question implies excellent service and wonders given good service, why do people tip less than 10%?. . A lot of people in the hospitality industry do the job because it fits a schedule where they can be students or moms or work a second job during the day, work in a restaurant during the night.  Restaurant servers need to \"tip out\" other employees  - busboys, bartenders - and it is not optional as well as cover those who occasion the restaurant to \"dine and dash.\". . I have worked a lot of jobs (including landscaping, factory work, dish-washing, and janitorial work) and serving tables is one of the tougher ones...just because you see the person for four minutes does not mean that they are not occupied with your interests nearly the entire time you are in the restaurant - before you showed up and after you leave.  There is a lot of risk in what your nightly income might be.  Sometimes worthwhile, sometimes not.. . For any of you who did not get the memo, here is current customary gratuity etiquette in the U.S.. . If you get awful service, talk to the manager. The manager cannot correct the situation if he doesn't know about it. Skipping the tip will not accomplish anything, and the next poor customer who gets that server will get the same service you did.. . If you are buying the meal and someone offers to get the tip, tell them they can buy next time, and you pay the whole thing. This prevents any uneasiness about them seeing the amount of the bill or worrying that they will be stingy on the tip.. . Restaurants report a percentage (around 12%) of the gross sales for food and beverage to the IRS for their staff. This means that if you have a $200 food bill and $200 wine bill, the restaurant will report 12% of $400 or $48 as income to the server. In other words, the server has to pay tax on it whether you tip it or not. If the restaurants do not report it accurately, the restaurant and the wait staff get audited by the IRS. . . Please don't get hung up on the 12%. It is just a reasonable example. I recommend tipping 10-15% on the alcohol and 15-20% on the food. 10% on the wine is perfectly acceptable. Whether to tip 10 or 15 percent would depend in large part on how helpful the server was in choosing the wine and serving it. . . Food server - 15-20% . Cocktail server - 15-20%. For free drinks in Vegas, tip $1-2 per round. . Bartender - 15-20% or $1 per drink. If at the bar before a meal, settle up with the bartender before you go to your table. . Wine steward - 10% of wine bill. . If a bar has a cover charge, you do not tip on it. . Busboys - Nothing, unless he did something extra special like cleaning up a huge mess. Then give him $1-2. . Maitre d' - Nothing, unless he gets you a special table or the restaurant is full and you had no reservation. Then give $5-10 or more. . Coat check - $1 . Restroom attendant - $1 . Separate checks - If you want separate checks, ask the server to go ahead and add 18% gratuity to each check. . Musician in lounge - $1-5 . Musician that visits table - $2-3 if you make a special request. Optional if he just stops by and plays. . Takeout - If you get good service, in other words, the waiter gets and packages the food, then tip $1-2 or up to 10%. . Drive through - Nothing. . Self-service restaurant or buffet - Nothing unless there is some service. Tip 10% if the server delivers all or part of your meal or keeps your drinks refilled. . When breakfast is included in the price of the hotel room - Estimate the value of the meal by looking at a menu. If there is no breakfast menu, consider the quality of the hotel",

When you are in this type of business, you have to always strive to do your best and not let the lousy tipper get you done even if it is disappointing. As for Streeter Mark, it takes alot more time than 4 minutes to serve a customer. From the time they sit down in your section to the time they leave, if you are any kind of waiter/waitress, you will be attentive to your customers until they leave that table. Even if it means just refilling water or coffee, or if they engage you in a conversation, not just being short with them. You need to be personable and be able to anticipate the customers needs before they ask for it. That does take a little bit of brains to do so. And by the way, being a server of any kind is not a degrading job, at least that person is working and not mooching off the system and if it wasn't for them, you wouldn't have a restaurant or a bar to go to since there wouldn't be anyone to serve you. You go bartender and do your thing and you'll get the good tippers and the bad too. Take it with a grain of salt and just do your job well. By the way, I tip on the quality of service I get. i.e.- if I have to ask for my drink to be refilled, or to have the dishes removed, etc.",

I was raised a Christian and converted to Wicca, something that's almost completely opposite, but to me Wicca is the religion that fits perfectly.  If you do not have that some comfortable feeling, the knowing that you're right in this matter and that what you were taught was just that--teaching, not belief--then you will not truly convert and will probably return to your former religion eventually.  Sorry, but if you believe in Jesus etc (and I thought it was God you were supposed to believe in, not Jesus, but oh, well, I haven't been a Christian in almost ten years so goodness knows it could have changed), you aren't going to be anything but Christian.",

But, if it causes guilt to linger, it is because you are not fully convinced about your view. Study a little more, seek to find the truth. Ask yourself why you want the change, what is the underlying motive. When your convictions are strong, based on truth and reason, you will not find guilt plaguing you any more.",

Light is composed of electromagnetic waves which travel independent of a medium. That is to say, light can travel in a vacuum, such as outer space. Electromagnetic waves travel very fast. In a vacuum, the speed is 300,000,000 meters per second; the maximum speed which energy may obtain. This value is abbreviated as \"c\" , and you may have seen it before as part of Einstein's equation E=mc2. However, when light passes through transparent materials, it slows down a bit. This is because electromagnetic waves interact with the subatomic components of matter. In water, for example, light slows down to around 0.75c, or 225,000,000 meters per second. Even in a material as dense as diamond light travels well over 100 million meters per second! . . Sound is created by small changes in pressure near the surface of a vibrating object. These changes are propagated through a material medium, such as air, like the ripples formed when one tosses a stone into a pool of water. Sound travels through air at about 340 meters per second. In contrast to light, sound often travels faster in dense materials. In liquid water, sound travels 1450 meters per second. And, in metals such as iron, sounds can travel well over 5000 meters per second. While this is about ten times the speed of a supersonic jet airplane, it is only a tiny fraction of the speed of light.",

So since we have two cases of the word we can imply that it covers both in a general way aka lizards. The word great in Hebrew can also mean big or huge so there you have it big lizards. As for the time gap look it also says the sun and the moon were created after the first day but is says that light and the world were created on the first day. This is obviously a mistake. The word for earth is the same world in Hebrew for land (aretz) this can be loosely translated to also mean matter so you can read from this light and then matter were created on the first day.

Most of the time they can tell you if they could be put with a 350 or a 400.  That may give you the answer.  In my experience, modifications or new parts have to be bought to put a 400 into a vehicle with a factory 305 or 350 (the tranny/converter fit too tight on a 400).  They are all 8 cylinders and I think that they are all machined from the same basic form.  Maybe someone could help me out here, but doesn't a 400 require a larger oil pan than a 350?  I believe the 305/350s are small blocks and the 400s are bigblocks.  Since it came from a dirt track car, it could be a 350 bored over to a 400.  I'm assuming you don't have it torn down or you could look at the crankshaft.  Something you can also look at the 8th number in your VIN (for the engine size originally in the truck - if it's a GM) and then see if it looks like your engine mounts were modified or the exhaust manifolds look like they fit tight - not an exact answer, but it should give you an idea.",

To me, it's like an addict finally being able to admit openly that he or she has a problem, and by making such admission, we are more open to accept the assistance that is needed.

When we Die we will stand before God and be Judged, not by a preist, only God and us. when we stand before God if we are Guilty he will punish us. How can he Forgive Us?. . Let me explain by asking you a few questions.............. . . Have you ever lied (even once--fibs, white lies, etc.)? Ever stolen (anything--the value is irrelevant)? Jesus said, \"Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart.\" Have you ever looked with lust? If you have said \"Yes\" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we\u2019ve only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. Nothing you\u2019ve ever done is hid from His holy eyes. Will you be innocent or guilty on the Day of Judgment? Listen to your conscience. You know that you will be guilty, and therefore end up in Hell. That\u2019s not God\u2019s will. He provided a way for you and I to be forgiven. . He sent His Son to take our punishment: \"God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\" He was bruised for our iniquities. Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. . Your own so-called \u201cgoodness\u201d can\u2019t get you into heaven any more than mine could.  Jesus is the only way to Heaven. He is the \"Door,\" the only \"mediator.\" There is salvation in no other name, so pray something like this: \"Dear God, I repent of all of my sins (confess them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Please forgive me and grant me your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus\u2019 name I pray. Amen.\"",

It contains enzymes that hydrolyze some complex sugars in plants that the human body doesn't have enzymes (or doesn't have enough enzymes) to digest.  . . When the body can't digest them totally, normal healthy bacteria in the gut do the job.  In the process, they produce large quantities of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide gases.  The enzymes in Beano break down the sugars into more digestible simple sugars before the bacteria can get to them.",

It was slang for a bean feast, an annual celebration which included a meal of beans and bacon.. The first parties were wazgoose parties held by printers, but in.  the 18th century when landowners started providing an annual feast for their farm labourers and families. The celebrations, with much cider drinking and dancing, lasted all day. The centrepiece was a hearty meal of beans and bacon. Apart from Sundays, it was the only paid holiday that the labourers had, so it was the highlight of their year and became known as a beanfeast. . . Later, the mill and factory owners of northern England adopted the same benevolent streak! This time they sent their workers on a day trip to the seaside. The bosses rented trains or convoys of charabancs (an early open-top motor coach) to take the whole workforce to resorts such as Blackpool, Skegness, and Scarborough. Enormous quantities of beer and sandwiches were also provided, and there was much frolicking, singing and drunkenness. The bosses discovered that paying for a day at the seaside for their workers, away from the dust and noise of the factory, was a worthwhile investment. It gave their workers something to look forward to and some fresh air for their lungs. It was a big event in the workers' lives. This was probably the only holiday they were likely to get, so it is only natural that they looked forward to the works' outing, or beano as it became known.",

However, up till today they still have not found any WMDs there nor any proof that WMDs were manufactured in iraq. It is now belived that those reasons are just a cover up. Also, the way the soldiers treat the iraqis puts doubt in ones mind as that certainly isnt the way to liberate the people. The real reason is believed to be oil. the price of oil was increasing and america needed more control over oil recources. It is also believed that G.Bush needed to show that he was indeed takin measures against terrorism as the media was reporting how he failed the country on numerous occasions such as 9/11 and this would help raise his status again. But for all we know he might just not like iraqis. Hope this helps.",

As for those names you wrote at the bottom, they are basically unknown in the US but this is how we would pronounce them:. DALL-zeel. MEN-zeez. la-MONT (much more common among Black people). . Similarly, the Irish name Caitlyn, pronounced kath-LEEN, is often pronounced KATE-lynn in the U.S., which I think sounds awful!",

If not go with science diet food for kittens.  Just make sure it's for kittens.   But no milk, no chocolate, no sweets, makes them very sick and extremely hard to digest and harmful.   If the cat needs milk go with a kitten formula sold at the pet stores.  good luck hun   Oh, and no table scarps also very difficult for babies.",

            "passage": "Fluid that accumulates in the pleural space because of trauma or disease is called pleural effusion. This condition may result from heart failure, cancer, pulmonary embolism, or inflammation. If blood is in the accumulating fluid, the condition is called \"hemothorax\"; if pus is present, it is called \"empyema\"; if air enters the space, it is called \"pneumothorax\"; and if there is chyle (milky fluid consisting of lymph and fat), it is called \"chylothorax.\" There are two types of pleural effusion, transudative and exudative. . . An imbalance between the venous-arterial pressure and the pressure within the pleural space (oncotic pressure) causes transudative effusions. Transudates contain few protein cells and little solid material content and have a clear, pale yellow color. Cardiac failure and, less commonly, liver and kidney disease cause transudative pleural effusion. . . Exudative effusions are caused by inflammation, infection, and cancer. Exudates have large amounts of protein cells, white blood cells, and immune cells that have migrated into the pleural fluid and deposited in tissues or on tissue surfaces. Exudates also are pale yellow in color but have a cloudy appearance. If pus is present because of infection (empyema), the fluid is yellow, cloudy, and has a foul odor. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism (blocked pulmonary artery), cancer, and trauma are common causes of exudative pleural effusion. . Mechanisms of Pleural Fluid Accumulation . An excessive amount of pleural fluid probably results from a combination of fluid draining into the tissues from the blood vessels and the overproduction of fluid by the mesothelial cells. Fluid accumulates in the pleural space by three mechanisms: increased drainage of fluid into the space, increased production of fluid by cells in the space, and decreased drainage of fluid from the space. . . Increased amounts of fluid drain from the circulation when there is hypertension in the venous system (creating pressure imbalance) or when there is too little protein in the blood. Ascites (fluid in the peritoneal space, or abdominal cavity) can drain through small perforations in the diaphragm. A large amount of fluid can drain directly into the pleural space this way. . . Abnormal mesothelial cells (as in asbestosis) can produce large amounts of fluid. White blood cells can accumulate in response to infection and inflammation in the pleural space (empyema). These cells produce fluid that is difficult to drain or that are in such large quantities that normal drainage through the lymphatic system simply cannot keep up. . . Malignant tumor cells can migrate (or metastasize) to the pleural space from essentially any type of tumor in the body. These cells can attach to either the visceral or parietal pleural surfaces or float freely in the pleural space and produce large amounts of fluid. . . When tumor cells block lymphatic drainage, fluid accumulates. If the blockage is located in the central lymphatic drainage system that drains chyle (milky fluid consisting of lymph and fat) to the thoracic duct, fluid rich in chyle accumulates in the pleural space",

Perhaps the most common of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), which occurs mainly in teenagers and young adults. It occurs when a person's body clock is running later than it should, resulting in sleep-onset and wakening times that are very late in relation to the daily cycle of life. It is at the extreme end of the 'night owl' syndrome: a night owl will typically choose to stay up until midnight, and sleep until 8 in the morning; a person with DSPS is unable to initiate sleep until well after 1 or 2 am, and has extreme difficulty awakening until late morning or close to noon.. . http://www.sunbox.com/Research/SCRD.asp",

This steering repositions the contact patches of the front and rear wheels such that the downforce vector (force due to gravity and centripetal reaction in a turn), projected through the center of mass, intersects the line joining them and thus produces no additional rolling torque on the bike.",

This dish was traditionally prepared by shaving the gerbil and brushing it with a light coating of olive oil and spices. The diner would then pick up the entire gerbil and stuff it into his/her mouth, the olive oil providing lubricant. However, in the Marquis' case, he was a long-time sufferer of halitosis, so much so that when his Greek manservant, Alexopolous, tried to drop the gerbil into the Marquis's mouth, it would writhe and wriggle in disgust at the fetid stench rising from his throat. Alexopolous, exhibiting a shrewdness known to the Greeks, had the idea of placing a few pieces of greens into the Marquis' mouth in order to entice the gerbil into his mouth. Voila! Success for the Marquis, and, over time, the creation of a delicious and satisfying dining tradition for all of us in the west.",

It has a firm, orange-colored center similar in texture and taste to peanut brittle (without the peanuts), that is coated in milk chocolate. The filling has a peanut butter taste, hence the name. When eaten, it tends to crumble and then take on a peanut buttery consistency.. Butterfinger was invented by the Curtiss Candy Company of Chicago, Illinois in 1923. The company held a public contest to choose the name of the candy bar. The name is a slang term used to describe a clumsy person, often in sporting events to describe an athlete who can't hold onto the ball. As an early publicity stunt and marketing ploy, the company dropped Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bars from airplanes in cities across the United States which helped increase its popularity.. One of the slogans currently used to advertise the candy bar is \"Break out of the ordinary!\" Prior to that, Bart Simpson and other characters from The Simpsons appeared in numerous advertisements for the product from 1989 to 2001, with the slogan \"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!\". Butterfinger was withdrawn from German shops due to consumer rejection when it was one of the first products to be labeled as containing genetically modified ingredients from corn.. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, the candy bar is now produced by Nestl\u00e9.",

If you were to connect a great big capacitor across the live and neutral wires (DON'T TRY IT!!), you can put a heavy load on the supply, but the power consumption registered on the meter will be zero.. . Why? Because when you apply a mains voltage signal to a capacitor, current and voltage are exactly 90 degrees out of phase, and so the power factor (cosine of 90 degrees) is zero - a purely reactive load. Most appliances have to be designed to have a power factor as close to 1 as possible (purely resistive load), so that the electricity suppliers don't get irate.",

        {
            "doc_id": "1308733_4",
            "passage": "According to the bee keepers who posted to the site below:. . The drone bees, whose sole role in life is to inseminate a queen bee, have served their purpose and, with cold weather coming on, their lazy ways and demands for food can no longer be tolerated. They are either driven out to die in the cold or, if they refuse to leave, are killed and carried out by their sisters who are rightly called worker bees.. .  . . Like us, the bees must prepare for the winter ahead and Tandy and I talked mainly about bees and beekeeping in winter.. .  . . Most of the upper hive bodies called \"supers\" where honey is stored were last removed in September, each hive usually giving up between 75 and 100 pounds of honey over the year. (The record for a single hive, Tandy told me, is over 300 pounds but professional beekeeper Sue Hubbell reports that in bad summers her Missouri hives can produce as little as 20 pounds.). .  . . Tandy leaves a several supers for the bees to feed on through the cold weather when outside food sources are not available. Some beekeepers, he told me, take more honey but leave sugar water for the bees to feed on.. .  . . That last honey the bees gathered mostly from our common fall flowers, goldenrods and asters. I read that an early cold snap can crystallize aster nectar and injure the bees carrying it. Tandy's bees feed mostly on goldenrod and he prefers that.. .  . . To defend themselves against cold, the remaining bees gather into a sphere-like area inside the hive. Each bee contributes a small amount of heat to the cluster maintaining the center at 68 degrees. It is colder at the periphery of the sphere but these outside bees elbow their way toward the center after a short time. Thus the mass of about 50,000 bees is constantly rotating. At the same time, as the honey is consumed in one part of the hive the cluster slowly shifts to another.. .  . . Remarkably, in late January the bees will become more active, in this way heating up the interior of their cluster to 86 degrees, enough to allow their queen to begin laying eggs.. .  . . Bees are fastidious housekeepers, but this can cause a problem in winter. They will not defecate in the hive and need occasional warm periods like our January thaws to allow them to make what are called cleansing flights. This can often be a problem for anyone hanging clothes on an outside line. Their sheets would quickly become yellow-spotted. In severe and unrelenting winters the constipated bees become ill and many die.. .  . . Moisture is another problem. Bees produce propolis, a bee glue with which they seal up cracks in the hive wall, but some ventilation must be provided to allow water vapor to escape. When there are deep snows, the heat of the hive will melt the surrounding snow cover but the beekeeper must carefully remove any residue so that water won't enter the hive. Other than that, Tandy said, there is little the beekeeper needs to do in winter.. .  . . Winter is also the best time, he told me, to become a beekeeper. Searching out catalogs, purchasing and preparing hive-building materials and ordering bees for spring should be done now. The Western New York Honey Producers is an active support group in the region but they do not offer instruction. Tandy generously offered to provide initial guidance to interested beginners himself. His Akron phone number is 716-542-9182.. .  . . Since most wild beehives have been lost to disease, we can thank amateur and professional beekeepers for the bees that not only produce honey but also pollinate our plants. We'll see those bees again when the red maples bud and the dandelions bloom early next spring.-- Gerry Rising",

A person experiencing untreated schizophrenia is typically characterized as demonstrating disorganized thinking, and as experiencing delusions or auditory hallucinations.. . Although the disorder is primarily thought to affect cognition, it can also contribute to chronic problems with behavior and emotion. Due to the many possible combinations of symptoms, heated debate is ongoing about whether the diagnosis necessarily or adequately describes a disorder, or alternatively whether it might represent a number of disorders. For this reason, Eugen Bleuler deliberately called the disease \"the schizophrenias\" plural, when he coined the present name.. . Diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of the patient, in combination with secondary signs observed by a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or other competent clinician. No objective biological test for schizophrenia exists, though studies suggest that genetics, neurobiology and social environment are important contributing factors. Current research into the development of the disorder often focuses on the role of neurobiology, although a reliable and identifiable organic cause has not been found. In the absence of objective laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis, some question the legitimacy of schizophrenia's status as a disease. Furthermore, some question the status of schizophrenia as a disease on the basis that they do not consider the condition to be an impairment.. . The term schizophrenia translates roughly as \"shattered mind,\" and comes from the Greek \u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 (schizo, \"to split\" or \"to divide\") and \u03c6\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd (phr\u0113n, \"mind\"). Despite its etymology, schizophrenia is not synonymous with dissociative identity disorder, also known as multiple personality disorder or \"split personality\"; in popular culture the two are often confused. Although schizophrenia often leads to social or occupational dysfunction, a predisposition toward aggressive behavior is little associated with the illness.",

            "passage": "Thats because people are spending instead. The reason they are spending is because of increased borrowing thanks to still existant low interest rates. Interest rates are low because the money supply is relatively large thanks to the FED's sales of treasury bonds, a monetary policy which allows us to stimulate economic growth by expanding our money supply and therefore offer low interest rates. Our large money supply has also contributed to the devaluation of the dollar (along with some inflation and an ever increasing trade defecit), encouraging foreign countries (especially China) to buy more treasury bonds from the FED, therefore floating us the money to further expand our money supply and keep interest rates down, even though the more bonds we sell, the greater out government debt (to China) since bonds are pretty much governmnet IOUs. . . In the long run, remember that the money people save is the same money banks use to lend out to borrowers. Without bond sales by the FED, the lack of savings in banks will shrink the pool of availiable money (excess reserves) banks have for loans. They will respond by raising interest rates. Investors will borrow less at higher interest rates. As costs increase, firms will cut production, people will be laid-off, and spending will once again decline with savings experiencing a rebound. Recession will return and be gone when increased savings has helped expand the pool of loanable funds, interest rates lower, and investment is attractive again. This is the buisiness cycle, an inevitable by-product of capitalism.. . By the way, I'm an AP Macroeconomics teacher. :)",

            "passage": "The savings rate is negative because people are living beyond their means. Back in 1933 when the US Government developed Social Security, it was announced as a supplimental income and citizens were asked to save at least 10% (15% reconmended) from each paycheck into some form of investment to be used for retirement. People didn't listen, but we had a Baby Boom which caused a population growth. Social Security was designed as a pyramid sceme to have the younger taxpayers support the retired ones. Not that many people lived to the age of 65 or 70 to collect Social Security back in 1933. In the 1960's the liberals forced birth control and abortion on the culture and society of the USA, which slowed down the population birth and stopped the Baby Boom. This caused a problem because that Social Security pyramid was now upside down due to a decrease in population births thanks to birth control and abortion, and thanks to medical advances people were living to the age of 65, 70, 80, 90, ect. This put a drain on the Social Security system and the US economy. It got worse in the 1980's 1990's as Baby Boomers begain to retire. The economy might crash in 2015 when the last of the Baby Boomers start to retire and the Social Security system will be paying out twice as much as it bring in with taxes.. . The negative savings has to do with Baby Boomers retiring and cashing in their stocks, IRAs, 401Ks, and other investments. It was starting to be felt in 1999 when the Dotcom companies and technology companies fell. The economy took a tumble in 1999 due to these factors. I myself lost $50,000 in savings in 1999 due to those economic factors making my IRA worth less money. 2000 started to get worse, and in 2001 we had a war going on, 2003 another war, deficit spending stimulated the economy a bit, but the savings rate took a hit.. . Materialism is partly to blame, people keep buying things to keep up with their neighbors. A failing health insurance system is to blame as well, as most bankrupcies are caused by high medical bills. Liberalism is partly to blame for forcing birth control and abortion on the population, causing a reverse Baby Boom, meaning fewer births. High gas prices are partly to blame, as it eats into people's savings. There are other factors as well.. . The economy is great, because it is a consumer driven economy. The more things people buy, the stronger the economy grows. The problem is that hardly anyone is saving, and most people are borrowing money to live on. Most people live paycheck to paycheck and cannot even follow a budget. Good for banks, good for businesses, good for the government that taxes them all, but bad for the consumer who now owes more money than before. Only people are selling stocks, instead of buying them, which is driving down income for most businesses as their stocks lower in value and they cannot raise capital. There are two ways a business can turn a profit, cut expenses or increase revenues. Since everyone is spending beyond their means, increasing revenue is not possible. So they stick to cutting expneses, like wage cuts or downsizing, in order to turn a profit for shareholders. If managers cannot turn a profit for shareholders, the shareholders will vote in new managers.",

Jewish people or anyone do not take offense but the WAR had greater repercussions than the Holocaust itself - here's why.... Estimates are that 6 million Jews were exterminated, worked to death, murdered in Europe.  The end state was that Jews created Israel in 1948.. Now compare the number of Chinese, Russian (and Slavs of Eastern Europe), German, French, Japanese that died totaling in the hundreds of millions.. The Holocaust was spurned by a decision of the Nazis to rid Europe of Jews as quickly as possible.  This decision (arguably) didn't have a huge bearing on how the Allies would fight the war and defeat Germany and Japan (unconditional surrender from the beginning).. Comparisons - how many tribes/people did Ghengis Khan crush rolling through out of the Asian steppe?  How many north African tribes (originally from Europe) were wiped out by invading Arabs in the early Middle Ages?  How many Chinese did good 'ole Mao kill or starve to death in the 1960s?  How many Russians and Soviets died under glorious Stalin over a thirty year reign? (Both killed more people than Hitler). My point is that no matter in what conflict, humans have always reached some level of absolute barbarism and lose total value in human life (more recently the Khomer Rouge (sp?) in Cambodia, Milosevic in former-Yugoslavia, Saddam in Iraq/Iran and today, Darfur).  . Unfortunately, there aren't many positive LONG term effects to make much difference after human atrocities occured.  At least not many difference makers that have been successful.  The SHORT term goals are usually very good - criminal trials of the accused, memorials/museums to the deceased/fallen.  . Bottom Line - World War II resulted in many global changes, lessons to be learned from the Holocaust have largely been forgotten...Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, China (over decades since), sub-Saharan Africa (Rwanda, Somalia, Darfur), Yugoslavia, former-USSR, Iran/Iraq War, etc etc...human atrocities will likely continue...",

I do mine at night to wake up with a clear sinus.

However, before you embark on reading Wittgenstein, make sure you've got a good grasp of Descartes, Plato, Locke and Hume - they're kind of what he's kicking against.. .

These include Descartes, Locke, Hume and Mill. Amongst Wittgenstein's contemporaries they include Russell and Quine. In addition, Ryle's book \"The Concept of Mind\", published just before Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\", is also highly influential as an argument aginst \"The ghost in the machine\", and is much more readable.. . Having placed Wittgenstein in context, his work is essential reading if you are to understand twentieth century philosophy, particuarly the philosophy of mind and of language, both of which have been crucial for twentieth century advances in thought. This applies both to Wittgenstein's earlier work, the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" with its picture theory of truth and the \"Philosophical Investigations\" which overturned Wittgenstein's earlier ideas with the notion of the language game.. . Wittgenstein is difficult to read, or rather to understand. You will need to read one, and probably several, of the many introductions to his works before approaching his main texts, and it will greatly help to go to lectures and/or tutorials on Wittgenstein. One reason is that Wittgenstein believed that philosophical works should stand on their own merit, and as a consequence the influence of previous philosophical thought on his work, for instance Augustine, Frege and Russell, is not always obvious.. . A further issue is that Wittgenstein's own ideas gave rise to a belief that the philosopher's personal life is irrelevant to his (or her) thought This belief has been followed by many more recent philosophers, but in Wittgenstein's own case it is very problematic. Wittgenstein's own life was remarkable in many ways, and deeply tortured. It may have led to inluences on his work that neither Wittgenstein nor his interpreters fully appreciate or wish to admit if they do. For this reason I would strongly suggest that you read the standard biography, \"Wittgenstein\" by Ray Monk, before or alongside your philsophical reading on Wittgenstein.",

Here is what Abraham Lincolon said on the subject:  . . \"For too long, every ounce of forgiveness I owned was locked away, hidden from view, waiting for me to bestow its precious presence upon some worthy person. Alas, I found most people to be singularly unworthy of my valuable forgiveness, and since they never asked for any, I kept it all for myself. Now, the forgiveness that I hoarded has spouted inside my heart like a crippled seed yielding bitter fruit. . No more! At this moment, my life has taken on new hope and assurance. Of all the world\u2019s population, I am one of the few possessors of the secret to dissipating anger and resentment. I now understand that forgiveness has value only when it is given away. By the simple act of granting forgiveness, I release the demons of the past about which I can do nothing, and I create in myself a new heart, a new beginning.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive even those who do not ask for forgiveness.. . Many are the times when I have seethed in anger at a word or deed thrown into my life by an unthinking or uncaring person. I have wasted valuable hours imagining revenge or confrontation. Now I see the truth revealed about this psychological rock inside my shoe. The rage I nurture is often one-sided, for my offender seldom gives thought to his offense!. . I will now and forevermore silently offer my forgiveness even to those who do not see that they need it. By the act of forgiving, I am no longer consumed by unproductive thoughts. I give up my bitterness. I am content in my soul and effective again with my fellowman.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive those who criticize me unjustly.. . Knowing that slavery in any form is wrong, I also know that the person who lives a life according to the opinion of others is a slave. I am not a slave. I have chosen my counsel. I know the difference between right and wrong. I know what is best for the future of my family, and neither misguided opinion nor unjust criticism will alter my course.. . Those who are critical of my goals and dreams simply do not understand the higher purpose to which I have been called. Therefore, their scorn does not affect my attitude or action. I forgive their lack of vision, and I forge ahead. I now know that criticism is part of the price paid for leaping past mediocrity.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive myself.. . For many years, my greatest enemy has been myself. Every mistake, every miscalculation, every stumble I made has been replayed again and again in my mind. Every broken promise, every day wasted, every goal not reached has compounded the disgust I feel for the lack of achievement in my life. My dismay has developed a paralyzing grip. When I disappoint myself, I respond with inaction and become more disappointed.. . I realize today that it is impossible to fight an enemy living in my head. By forgiving myself, I erase the doubts, fears, and frustration that have kept my past in the present. From this day forward, my history will cease to control my destiny. I have forgiven myself. My life has just begun.. . I will forgive even those who do not ask for forgiveness. I will forgive those who criticize me unjustly. I will forgive myself.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit.\"",

A \"Check Engine\" Light or Service Engine Soon is an indicator of the internal status of a car engine. It is found on the instrument console of most automobiles. When illuminated, it is typically either a red or amber color.. . The \"Check Engine\" Light, also sometimes known as a MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp), can illuminate for any of a very large number of reasons. Typically, the reason is not serious enough to affect drivability of the vehicle. Common causes include: loose gas cap, vehicle due for scheduled maintenance, or problems with the emmision control system (i.e., charcoal canister or oxygen sensor).. . This light became required on passenger cars due to emission control legislation in California, with the intention that the light would illuminate if there was a problem which would cause the vehicle to have excessive pollutant emissions. The owner would be aware that the emission control system needed to be serviced, and would be prevented from renewing their registration in the state of California. [citation needed]. . The \"Check Engine\" Light can also illuminate for reasons which may affect drivability, so it is advisable that one have the vehicle examined by a mechanic at one's earliest convenience. A preliminary diagnostic check can be performed by retrieval of the \"trouble code\" which has caused the light to illuminate. The cost of hooking up a diagnostic computer to retrieve said code varies greatly. Many dealerships charge $99 for this service.[citation needed] Private mechanics typically charge between $50 and $75[citation needed] while AutoZone offers the service for free.. . Once a \"trouble code\" has been pulled, the technician will have a better idea of what the problem may be. These codes are seldom specific, but instead tend to relate to a system of complex parts, thus requiring further diagnosis. Said diagnosis will require paying the hourly labor fee of a skilled technician.[citation needed]",

It goes on to list that the average buyer is 40 years of age, the average gamer is 33 years of age, and 50% of all Americans play video games- that's a rather large chunk out of the population, and it's a longshot to assume that part of that chunk doesn't include girl-gamers.. . Surveys have been conducted to disprove that gamers are predominantly male. While it is true that the average consumer nowadays is 20-30 years old and male, more and more female gamers are being found. A few studies claim that females outnumber males in Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs), and the ESA backs this by claiming that, while not outnumbering females, 48% of the MMO population is female. A substantial number do play games provided by internet services (like word jumbles and puzzles). Perhaps one of the most popular games noted for being played premarily by females is \"The Sims\" series, which is effectively a Life-simulator.. . Even if one disregards this, a number of the most popular video game characters have been female in the past: Lara Croft is one example of sexuality combined with hardcore action and adventure; Samus Aran was a character in Metroid whom every person played thinking she was a male until the very end. It's becoming something of a more attractive theme to have females that play the role of action heros or are otherwise the main characters, rather than males, while simultaneously disregarding the stereotype that all video game females are damsels in distress.",

This bulbous, along with the female's vaginal muscle, ensures that the 'tie' cannot be broken until all the semen is pumped from both testicles, which happens as alternative spurts from each teste. . Once the tie has occurred, you MUST WAIT until the female relaxes her vaginal 'locking' muscle and breaks the tie to release the male..

First off, all will agree that the audio in a commercial is generally very loud. 2ndly, when a show \"fades to black\" to go to commercial, both the video and the audio portion are faded down to zero.  So, when the commercial comes on, it sounds like it's much louder than the show you were watching. What you are hearing is the loudness difference between the quiet part of the show fading to black, and the commercial coming on \"balls to the wall\".  Additionally, when the show has a very loud scene going on, like a chase scene, it's no quieter than the commercials. The commercials just \"seem\" louder because of the way human ears work. This can easily be proven using test equipment to measure the peak audio signal during both events.",

There were 13 people at the Lord\u2019s Last Supper before he was crucified. Also he was crucified on a Friday. So the number is considered unlucky and ominous. . . .

The flight left the launch pad at 13 minutes past the hour on April 13th.. .

If the inventors of the \"male dominated\" solar calendar didn't care about the feminine moon, they would have based their months on something else.. .

If it is the cat peeing/pooping in your room and not the litter box, then I would suggest several items.  Is this more than once?  Are they spayed/neutered?  (If not, they should be).. . First, have him/her checked by a vet. You will want to rule out any physical problems such as a UTI or other issues. Is he neutered? (If not, that raises a different series of physical causes).. . Second, you need to remove 100% of the odor from the area he urinated. Just because you can't smell it doesn't mean they can't! Pets stores sell special cleaners such as natures miracle to help with this.. . Assuming it is physical, address that issue with your vet.. . If it is not physical, ask yourself has anything changed? . . Did you move the litter boxes? Did you change the brand of litter? Are the litter boxes still in a fairly attractive area for the cat(and well away from their food/water)? Does the cat feel safe?  (I have heard all sorts of stories about this -- people not figuring out that: leaving the boxes in the basement with no lights at all; placing a dog crate next to the cat box; putting the cat box next to the cat food, etc. are all bad ideas). . . Have you added any new people or pets to the household? Have you changed your routine a great deal. Put simply, cats hate change!. . You also might want to restrict access to that room except when you are present. That can help prevent the problem -- and would help determine the cause.. . I also like the Feliway pheromone spray if the cat seems to be marking their territory.",

A SERIOUS answer to your question (not just an opinion of your dog licking you) If it is a constant licking (like almost obsessive) it is a sign of being territorial...in a sense. There are a few ways to fix this. For one, when they lick you without your invitiation, a snap on the nose and a firm NO might get the point across. . Train him to lick you on command. When he licks you, say \"good boy, gimme kisseys\" or whatever you want. When you dont give the command and he licks you, tell him no. This will give him the idea of when it's right and when its wrong.. Also, a good idea would be to put him in submissive position, because obsessive licking does have a tendency to be territorial. Submissive position, if you're unaware, is something they do in dog packs where the Alfa (you) challanges the lower (your dog) by putting him on his back and staring into his eyes until he looks away. when you do this, keep a firm pressure on his chest. Since hes a bigger dog, you might need your knee. Do this until he calms and looks away, even if he cries. YOu might even notice how he will listen to you more after this. All your doing is telling him that you are the boss, and he has to do what you say. DOnt worry...This happens in dog packs all the time. It wont hurt him; your just thinking like him :D . good luck!",

How or why did saying \"God bless you\" become associated as an expression one says to another after the other sneezes? Some reasons listed below, but, somehow, I don't think any of them are very legitimate:. . * When someone sneezes his heart stops and saying \"God bless you\" means \"I'm glad your heart started again.\". * Saying \"God bless you\" when you sneeze keeps the devil from flying down your throat.. * When someone sneezes, say \"God bless you and may the devil miss you.\". * When you sneeze your soul tries to escape and saying \"God bless you\" crams it back in (said by Millhouse in an episode of The Simpsons).",

The old expression was \"Jupiter preserve you\" or \"Jupiter help me\"  Its basis was the ancient Indo-European concept of the air-soul or breath-soul (Atman), which might be expelled from the body by a violent rush of air unless prevented by a verbal charm.  Covering the mouth during a yawn arose from the same fear of losing the soul.  Medieval churchmen accepted the superstition, and taught that both sneezing and yawning should be immediately protected by the sign of the cross, because \"Ofttimes a man sneezed, and expired at the moment of sneezing...In like manner it often befell that man yawned, and fell dead.\"",

Crowds took to the streets praying to God and when a person sneezed they were immediately blessed God bless you! for fear that they may be developing symptoms of the plague.",

However, any price between $10,000 and $15,000 is Pareto efficient because the seller receives more value in money than the value he places on the car, and the buyer values the car more than the money he pays for it.

The photon because of its weird nature as a force carrier called a boson has no mass. However it can still be absorbed, reflected, or refracted if it come in contact with a medium. That is why like sound the speed of light slightly varies between when it is in our atmosphere and when it is in space.

According to About.com, low levels of TSH, or thyroid-stimulating hormone, occur when the pituitary gland shuts down TSH production due to high levels of thyroid hormone in the blood. The low levels of TSH are the pituitary gland's attempt to keep thyroid hormone levels normal within the body. What are some symptoms associated with high TSH levels? According to WebMD, high TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels indicate an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Common symptoms include feeling weak, tired or depressed, sensitivity to cold, constipation, brittle nails, memory problems, and heavy or irregular periods.",

Please impartially judge and evaluate the quality of the two candidate answers to a non-factoid question and choose the better answer. 
Your evaluation should consider factors such as the correctness, fluency, truthfulness and redundancy.
*Correctness* measures the coherence of the answer and its corresponding question. 
*Fluency* measures the language smoothness and quality of the given answer.
*Truthfulness* measures whether the text of the answer is factually sound, including the factual consistency
of the answer and whether the answer contains contradictions or hallucinate information. 
*Redundancy* measures the duplication of content within the limited text length. Repetitive content will reduce informativeness. The lower redundancy, the higher score of the answer.
Begin your evaluation by comparing the two responses and provide a short explanation. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision.Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants.Be as objective as possible.
After providing your explanation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: \"[[A]]\" if assistant A is better, \"[[B]]\" if assistant B is better, and \"[[C]]\" for a tie.
